</div>

<p class='c014'>Seven o’clock had struck.</p>

<p class='c015'>The gong at 37, Beaconsfield Gardens,
South Kensington, thundered under the
vigorous strokes of the bow-legged German
waiter. By one, by two, by three, the
boarders trooped down to dinner, the more
sensitive to noise stopping their ears as they
descended.</p>

<p class='c015'>The very deafest could not ignore that
gong. Müller always attacked it suddenly,
as if running amuck or possessed by a demon.
It reverberated far and near, and echoed
faintly to Gloucester Road Station. Boarders,
arriving late, were seen to run when their
ears caught the familiar sound.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>At the head of the central table in the fine
dining-room, its three windows looking on
the Gardens, sat the proprietress, Mrs.
Wilcox. She was a bright-eyed, stout, florid
woman of forty-five, dressed in black silk
and a lace fichu secured by a cameo brooch.
As she waited for her guests, she meditatively
sharpened a carving knife.</p>

<p class='c015'>By the sideboard stood her husband, Captain
Wilcox, slender, dried-up, younger than
his wife, and dominated by her. Where they
met, and why they married, was a never-failing
source of speculation in the house.
It was asserted that Miss Tompkins took
him in payment of a debt. Be that as it
might, the mild, subdued little Captain was
evidently a gentleman. He had been in a
Lancer regiment, got into difficulties, and
now at eight-and-thirty was a person of much
less importance in his wife’s boarding-house
than her imposing cook.</p>

<p class='c015'>Though never supposed to act as master,
the name and authority of Captain Wilcox
were frequently evoked by Mrs. Wilcox
when any unpleasant duty had to be done.
He it was, for instance, who sternly insisted
that no credit should be given. He stood
out for the weekly settlement of accounts.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>He was responsible for certain persons receiving
notice to quit. He made the unpopular
rule that the drawing-room lights should be
extinguished precisely at eleven. In a word,
he was the Jorkins of the firm. For the
rest, he held some small post in the City
secured for him by his wife’s brother, helped
daily with the carving, and paid for his own
keep.</p>

<p class='c015'>Besides the central table, there were round
the room several smaller ones, accommodating
from four to eight persons. To one of these,
some men and women concerned in our story
were making their way. First came Miss
Augusta Semaphore, a tall, thin, and rather
acid-looking woman of fifty-three. Close
behind followed her sister, Miss Prudence,
who was ten years younger, and accustomed
to be treated as a baby. Prudence wore a
fringe that hung over her eyes in separate
snaky curls, and in damp weather degenerated
into wisps; she was plump and fair, had a
somewhat foolish smile, and, as befitted her
part of giddy, little thing, any number of
coquettish airs and graces.</p>

<p class='c015'>Their neighbours were, a stately couple
named Mr. and Mrs. Dumaresq, Mr. Lorimer,
a clownish youth, of good family and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>aggressive patriotism, Major Jones, Mrs.
Whitley, a small, mincing lady of recent
and painful refinement, and finally a large
and commanding woman with a terrible eye,
who was vaguely believed to have taken out
a medical degree.</p>

<p class='c015'>“For what we are about to receive,” said
Mrs. Wilcox, “the Lord make us truly thankful.”</p>

<p class='c015'>With a creak and a rustle, some five-and-thirty
boarders drew in their chairs. The
covers were removed, and a ripple of prosy
talk began.</p>

<p class='c015'>As usual, it started with polite enquiries as
to each other’s health. In boarding-houses
it generally does. No one cares a button for
you or your ailments, but they ask after them
all the same with exasperating regularity and
take no interest in the answer.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How is your cold, Major Jones?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Better, thank you, Mrs. Dumaresq—and
your neuralgia?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Much worse; I never closed my eyes
last night.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But you are taking something for it?”—and
so on, and so on, and so on.</p>

<p class='c015'>New comers at 37, Beaconsfield Gardens,
occasionally tried to be conversational. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>a time they were lively, animated, full of good
stories and repartee. People listened to
them in silence, and generally took offence.
Conversation as a fine art was not encouraged.
It was sad to notice how in a week or
a fortnight the talkers talked themselves out,
and subsided into the brief commonplaces of
their neighbours.</p>

<p class='c015'>The boarders, all respectable people who
read the <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite> and voted Tory
when they had votes, shared the profound
belief of the middle-class Briton that silence
shows solidity, sound judgment, and a well-balanced
mind. Profound and continued
silence they considered an attainment in
itself. They scarcely realised, not being introspective,
that two-thirds of the people
who don’t speak are silent from lack of
ideas.</p>

<p class='c015'>As a matter of fact, in such a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">milieu</span></i>, subjects
for conversation of general interest were
almost impossible to find. By tacit consent,
politics and religion were tabooed, since the
discussion of either invariably ended in a
quarrel. Though the boarders read novels,
they did not talk about them, and they took
no great interest in literature or art. A man
who was supposed to have written a book was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>rather cold-shouldered, for the Englishman—and
in this case, as the preacher put it, man
embraces woman—whatever his respect for
literature in the abstract, thinks but meanly
of those who produce it, if they do not
happen to be celebrities. To be sure they
are generally poor.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Vill you beef, muddon, schiken, or feal?”
whispered Müller, making his round when
soup and fish had been removed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Veal, please,” said Miss Semaphore.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Feal, blease,” said Müller under his
breath, to impress the order on his mind.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Vill you beef, muddon, schiken, or feal,
Madame?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“A portion—a tiny portion of the—a—chest
of the fowl,” said Mrs. Whitley.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Roast beef,” growled Mr. Lorimer, and
Müller echoed “beef,” adding “blease” on
his own account.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I saw you to-day, Major Jones, but you
did not see me,” said the younger Miss
Semaphore archly, when the interest of
choosing had subsided.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You what?” asked Major Jones mildly.
He was rather deaf.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I said that I saw you to-day—down in
the City, you know. Fancy! I went all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>that distance by myself in an omnibus!
There is such a sweet shop for bargains in
St. Paul’s Churchyard, and you passed me
just as I turned in.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You should not go into the City unescorted,”
said Miss Augusta Semaphore
severely; “I have told you that over and
over again, but you are so heedless. It is
not <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comme il faut</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What do you think would happen to
her?” asked Mr. Lorimer gruffly. He was
a young man of combative instincts and no
manners, with whom Miss Semaphore waged
a deadly but, on her side, perfectly civil warfare.</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear father,” went on Miss Semaphore,
without taking any notice, “who was
a distinguished military officer, strongly
objected to girls going about alone.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That was all very well thirty years ago,”
objected Mr. Lorimer, “but nowadays, if
people conduct themselves properly, there is
no earthly reason why they should not go
about alone at fit and proper hours, once they
have come to years of discretion.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I can assure you,” said Mrs. Dumaresq,
assuming a grand air, and slightly raising her
voice, as she always did when she meant to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>impress her hearers, “I can assure you that
in diplomatic circles, a lady shopping without
an escort, or at any rate without a maid, is
unheard of.”</p>

<p class='c015'>In every boarding-house throughout the
British Islands there is to be found a person
who is the intimate friend of the Prince of
Wales. At 37, Beaconsfield Gardens, Mrs.
Dumaresq was that person.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, all very well amongst a lot of horrid
foreigners,” said Mr. Lorimer obstinately;
“no wonder ladies are afraid to go about
alone where there’s a set of ugly, unwashed
rascals that would run a dagger into them as
soon as look at them, but grown-up Englishwomen
in their own country may do what
they please.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I do not approve of ladies going anywhere
alone. It may do for middle-class
persons,” said Mrs. Dumaresq haughtily,
“but I can assure you, from personal knowledge,
that it is not done in diplomatic circles.
When we lived at Belgrade, there was a
Mrs. Twickenham who used to act in the
most unconventional way, and one day the
Princess—a dear old friend of ours—the
Princess Hatzoff—you must have heard of
her, first cousin to the Czar, a delightful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>woman and so attached to me—said, ‘Dearest
Mimi’—she always called me Mimi—‘are
English ladies in their own country, ladies of
position such as you and I, allowed this
liberty, not to say license, of action?’ and I
replied, ‘No, Helène, certainly not.’”</p>

<p class='c015'>The Misses Semaphore, Mrs. Whitley,
and the lady doctor listened attentively to
these reminiscences, but Mr. Lorimer was
not impressed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I maintain,” he said, “that this is a free
country, and that those ideas are old-fashioned.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I assure you that is not the opinion of the
Princess Hatzoff, a woman who mixed in the
very best society; nor was it the opinion of
my dear friend, the ex-Empress of the French,
Mr. Lorimer,” replied Mrs. Dumaresq with
a lofty air. “However, we will discuss the
matter no further. In diplomacy one learns
to avoid subjects on which one’s experiences
are different from those of other people, and
so not likely to agree.”</p>

<p class='c015'>There was a subdued acidity in Mrs.
Dumaresq’s tone, there was a battle-breathing
obstinacy in Mr. Lorimer’s accent that
led peaceful Miss Prudence to change the
conversation.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“The poor dear Empress,” she said, “how
I pity her!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Ah, you should have seen her in her
splendour. Were you in Paris before the
war?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You can scarcely expect my sister to
remember Paris before the war, my dear
Mrs. Dumaresq,” interposed Miss Semaphore
frigidly. “It is years ago. Prudence was a
mere child.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Dumaresq smiled slightly, and said,
“Ah!” In diplomatic circles no one openly
expresses disbelief in a statement.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The dear Empress was such a friend of
mine in the old days when we lived there.
One day, I remember so well, we had been
away for nearly a year. The Empress was
standing at a window of the Palace with an
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aide-de-camp</span></i> beside her, Comte de la Tour—you
remember Comte de la Tour, Angelo?”
This to her silent husband, who nodded
assent. “The Empress suddenly said to the
Comte, ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon cher</span></i>, who is that charmingly-dressed
lady who has just driven past?’
The Comte, dear man, answered, ‘Oh, your
Majesty, do you not know? that is Madame
Dumaresq!’ The same evening we met at
a ball at the Spanish Ambassador’s, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Empress graciously came up to me. ‘Fancy,’
said she; ‘fancy, my dear Madame Dumaresq,
I did not recognise you this morning. It is
such an age since you were here; and oh!
do permit me to congratulate you on the
exquisite costume you wore.’”</p>

<p class='c015'>The story made a distinct impression.
The medical woman at the end of the table,
who had an American’s interest in high life,
stopped short in a thrilling narrative of an
amputation, and listened with all her ears.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The Empress was a very lovely woman,
but I believe she was not very young when
she married,” said the elder Miss Semaphore
reflectively.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, dear no! Eight or nine-and-twenty
at least. Some people said two-and-thirty.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What matter does that make?” interposed
the polite Mr. Dumaresq. “A handsome
woman is only the age she looks.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Miss Semaphore sighed. She had carefully
examined her face before dinner and
discovered a new wrinkle. It was borne in
on her that she scarcely looked as young as
she felt, but she made an effort to seem as if
eight-and-twenty, or, at most, two-and-thirty,
was still before her.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It must be dreadful to grow old,” said
Mrs. Whitley affectedly.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>“There are so many aids to beauty nowadays,”
said Mr. Dumaresq, “that no lady
need look a day older than she likes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But the use of cosmetics is odious,” cried
Miss Semaphore. “For my part I never
could understand how any one could use
paints and powders.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Good breeding was not Mr. Lorimer’s
strong point, and, in boarding-houses, people
say things to each other that elsewhere are
the privilege of relatives.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Dyes,” he said, looking fixedly at Miss
Semaphore’s hair, “dyes are most injurious—worst
of all, in fact. Horrible case in the
paper the other day. A woman dyed her
hair black one morning, died herself next!
Instantaneous softening of the brain, they
said. The stuff soaked in.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The obvious application lent point to the
sally. The medical lady, who prided herself
on being a fine woman, needing no aid from
art, smiled broadly. She could not, however,
resist saying there was no such disease as
instantaneous softening of the brain.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Dumaresq, mindful of her diplomatic
training, looked so grave that a child would
have suspected something wrong. Miss
Semaphore murmured “How dreadful!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>She alone saw no personal allusion, for it
never struck her that anyone could think she
tinted her tresses. Miss Prudence looked as
angrily at the speaker as her kind face permitted.
Major Jones had just said, “Eh!
what’s that?” when Mrs. Wilcox rose, and
at her signal the ladies swept upstairs, leaving
the men to cigars and scandal.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='large'>A BOARDING-HOUSE EVENING, AND AN IMPORTANT LETTER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Boarding-houses all the world over have
certain features in common. These are the
result of haphazard association between
people without common interests.</p>

<p class='c015'>No. 37, Beaconsfield Gardens, South Kensington,
was no exception to the rule.
Its inmates were chiefly women, the widows
and daughters of professional men. A few
childless married couples lived there, and a
sprinkling of unmarried men who were either
old or extremely young. Some of the people
were well-connected, others well-off, all were
dull, a few pious. Several secretly considered
themselves superior to the others. They
focussed the attributes of the British Philistine,
and were an object-lesson as to the
low intellectual level of average respectable
humanity.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Lacking occupation and mutual outside
interests, the boarders were led to discuss
each other freely. The men mostly herded
together in the smoking-room. The ladies
gathered in the drawing-room. A sort of
armed neutrality was maintained between the
sexes. He or she who ventured to invade
the headquarters of the other was looked on
as daring or brazen as the case might be.
At meals alone did some thirty-five people
assemble. Even then, they were not expected
to change their place at table, so had to trust
to chance for agreeable neighbours.</p>

<p class='c015'>The few girls who lived in the house
had not a gay time. Poor things! They
had no lovers, no interests, no society,
no prospects, and incomes that required
management. Once they ceased to be
new arrivals, the men, all of whom were
ineligible, took no notice of them. They
were treated with a nonchalance more
galling than unkindness, and were subtly
given to understand that they could not
expect the same consideration as young
women outside who lived in their own
homes and had parents who entertained.
The elderly people, and especially Miss
Semaphore, looked rigidly after the proprieties.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Occasionally a dashing widow or an attractive
and forward damsel temporarily upset
the dulness. Dances were organised, round
games started, heads turned. These brilliant
meteors never lingered long on the horizon.
Their stay usually terminated in some episode
that led to a notice to quit. The succeeding
flatness was the more marked.</p>

<p class='c015'>There is no dulness in the quietest home
like the dulness that falls at intervals on a
boarding-house. It may be that at home one
does not expect much, while living with a
number of strangers one feels restless, as if
something really ought to happen.</p>

<p class='c015'>There are blanks and periods of depression,
extending sometimes to months at a time,
when life seems a waste. During these,
efforts to get up any amusement are useless.
No one will help, and so much cold water is
thrown on every suggestion, that in despair
the promoter abandons the project.</p>

<p class='c015'>Such an interval was now being put
through at No. 37. Conversation, as we
have indicated, languished, being replaced by
an occasional interchange of platitudes, failing
any private or public sensation. An
audacious flirtation on the part of one of the
younger women, or a thrilling murder trial,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>would have interested everybody, especially
the flirtation, on the progress of which the
boarders would have taken turns to watch
and comment on.</p>

<p class='c015'>Relieved of all household duties, the
“ladies,” as Mrs. Wilcox never failed to call
them, passed the monotonous days in shopping,
novel-reading, and repose. They made
up temporary friendships between themselves
and fell out with regularity. As usual,
they were split into two factions, those who
abused the proprietress and those who did
not.</p>

<p class='c015'>The drawing-room in which they nightly
assembled was a spacious apartment. A
Brussels carpet of pronounced pattern, red
Utrecht velvet chairs—solid, as befitted furniture
destined to much wear and tear—and
gilt-framed mirrors, gave the apartment an
early Victorian aspect. The light and airy
found no place in this salon, for in boarding-houses
everything breakable is broken, and
nobody owns to the mischief.</p>

<p class='c015'>Workbaskets, newspapers, and novels were
brought out this evening as usual, and nearly
all the party became absorbed in one or other
of these excitements. They had exhausted
each other, though one or two kept up a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>dribble of civil enquiries for the sake of saying
something.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What pretty work. How do you do it?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh! it is a new stitch I have just
learned.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Were you out this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No; I lay down and took a nap. Were
you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, I went down to High Street for
some wool.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The evening to which we refer, though as
dull, was not destined to be as peaceful as its
fellows. The cause of the disturbance was
Miss Semaphore’s dog. Miss Semaphore’s
dog was a mongrel, a snappish little brute
called Toutou. Its brown hair was flecked
with grey, for it was old, fat, and scant of
breath. Toutou had been the cause of more
unpleasantness at 37, Beaconsfield Gardens,
than any other inmate. If, in the quarrels of
men, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cherchez la femme</span></i> holds good, in the
quarrels of idle women who live in boarding-houses
one may not unfrequently look for
the dog. To-night, unfortunately for herself,
Miss Belcher, one of the younger women,
trod on its tail. Frankly, it was difficult to
avoid treading on Toutou’s tail, for he had
a trick of getting into the way that was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>simply exasperating. Miss Belcher, a nice,
harmless girl, jumped as if she had been
shot.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, I am so sorry!” she cried; “doggie,
poor doggie, are you hurt?” and kneeling
down, she tried tenderly to soothe him.
Toutou was not hurt, but he howled desperately.
Judging by his actions he rather
enjoyed getting people into trouble. In an
instant Miss Semaphore swooped down, red
and angry, seized her favourite, and casting
a withering glance at the crestfallen
Miss Belcher, carried him off to her own
particular corner.</p>

<p class='c015'>Everyone at 37, Beaconsfield Gardens, had
a special chair or a favourite corner, and great
was the indignation if anyone else took it.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It was quite an accident,” stammered
Miss Belcher. “I never saw Toutou.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Some people,” replied Miss Semaphore,
“have no eyes. They think it rather amusing
to torture dumb animals, don’t they, my
precious?” As she spoke, she bestowed a
kiss like a peck on the top of Toutou’s ugly
nose. The boarders all ceased work and
listened attentively.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But indeed, Miss Semaphore,” cried poor
Miss Belcher, almost crying, “it was not my
fault.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“I suppose, of course, it was Toutou’s,”
said Miss Semaphore with sarcasm.</p>

<p class='c015'>Miss Belcher was getting the worst of it,
when her mother, a large, deaf woman of
majestic presence, interposed. She domineered
over her daughter and everyone else,
and had been silent so far because she had
been having the state of the case explained
in her ear by Mrs. Whitley.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t mind, Emma,” she said suddenly,
“That ridiculous dog is in everyone’s way,
It should be got rid of.” Turning to the
embarrassed Mrs. Whitley, she made what
appeared to be indignant comments on Miss
Semaphore, the obnoxious word “old maid”
being distinctly audible.</p>

<p class='c015'>At this awful crisis the boarders stared
panic-stricken at Miss Semaphore.</p>

<p class='c015'>Miss Semaphore, under other circumstances,
would have justified their apprehensions.
Even she, however, saw it was no
use quarrelling with a deaf woman endowed
with a terrible tongue. Accordingly, she
simply muttered, “Disgraceful!—ill-bred!”
and something about “the result of association
with such persons,” and relapsed into an
oppressive silence.</p>

<p class='c015'>The innocent little dribble of talk dried up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>before the sirocco of her suppressed wrath.
A silence that might be felt reigned in the
drawing-room. Though glances were interchanged,
no one ventured to speak except
Mrs. Belcher. She, greatly daring, and
with the evident intention of flouting both
Miss Semaphore and Toutou, addressed her
daughter on all manner of subjects, compelling
that unhappy young person to reply at
the top of her voice. Miss Prudence, who
always shrank from her sister’s outbursts,
buried herself timidly in the pages of the
<cite>Lady’s Pictorial</cite> and tried to look as if she
had heard nothing.</p>

<p class='c015'>When this painful state of things had
lasted for some time, Mrs. Dumaresq, by
way of creating a diversion, said in her most
fascinating manner,</p>

<p class='c015'>“That dreadful Mr. Morley has been making
another speech. I’m sure it is a wonder
how anyone can be found to listen to him.
Radicals and Socialists and those sort of
people really ought to be locked up.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Perhaps, on their side, they think Tories
should be locked up,” said Miss Stott, a
thick-set young person with views.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No doubt they do,” answered Mrs.
Dumaresq with energy. “No doubt, if they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>could, they would have all the aristocracy
beheaded. As my dear friend, the Baroness
de la Veille Roche, once said to me, ‘My
darling Mimi, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">canaille</span></i> would wade in our
blood if they dared.’”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I doubt it,” said Miss Stott stolidly;
“people are not as bloodthirsty as that, even
if they are Radicals or Socialists. After all,
human beings are very much alike in the
grain whatever their rank, and none of us
would care particularly to wade in blood.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Alike!” echoed Mrs. Dumaresq. “My
dear Miss Stott, you are mistaken. Between
the upper and the lower classes there is the
greatest possible difference. They have not
our sensitiveness, our refinement, our delicacy.”
Mrs. Dumaresq said “our” to show
she knew her manners, and to accentuate
her diplomatic training.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do you think not?” queried Miss Stott.
“Of course they have not external refinement,
nor the advantages of education. But
do you really think they are less sensitive,
less delicate in their own way? Why,
every day there are cases in the paper that
seem to show Belgravia and Whitechapel are
very much alike when their blood is up.
The chief difference to me appears to be that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>the one does things and does not talk of
them, while the other talks of them but does
not do them.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear Miss Stott!” remonstrated Mrs.
Dumaresq.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes,” said Miss Stott, “why only to-day
I read the account of an action taken by a
servant against her mistress, a wealthy
woman, who broke her fan on her maid’s
shoulder.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How shocking!” said Mrs. Dumaresq.
“But you must not judge the aristocracy by
such persons. The woman, though she may
have been rich, could not possibly have been
a lady.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“So I think,” replied Miss Stott; “no
doubt, however, she considered herself one,
for she was an Earl’s daughter.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh—h!” said Mrs. Dumaresq, with great
surprise. “Then the maid must have been
very provoking.”</p>

<p class='c015'>A rattle of teacups announced the arrival
of coffee.</p>

<p class='c015'>Miss Prudence Semaphore, who was seated
in the centre of the room near the lamp,
looked round to see if any of the men had
come up, and dropped her <cite>Pictorial</cite>. As
she recovered it, an advertisement caught
her eye.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c016'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“<span class='sc'>To Ladies and Gentlemen of Means</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“The widow of an eminent explorer, being in
straitened circumstances, is compelled to offer for sale a
single bottle of water from the Fountain of Youth, vainly
sought in Florida by Ponce de Leon. Its marvellous
rejuvenating properties cannot be exaggerated. By its
means a person of seventy may regain, after six small
doses, the age of eighteen. This is genuine. No cosmetic.
No imposture. No connection with any preparation
making similar claims. The greatest marvel of
this or any other century. Money willingly returned if
above statement is proved untrue. Please address offers,
which must be liberal, as this opportunity is unique, to
X. Y. Z., Office of this Paper.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Greatly struck by the announcement, which
she read twice, Miss Prudence passed the
paper to her sister, saying, “Look at that!”
She then pulled out some knitting, and became
absorbed in the mysteries of “slip one,
knit one, bring the thread forward, knit two
together.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Miss Semaphore adjusted her long-handled
eye-glasses, sole concession to failing sight.
Spectacles were abhorrent to her, and even a
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pince nez</span></i> she considered too plain an acknowledgment
of weakness. She was even more
impressed by the advertisement than Miss
Prudence had been, and considered it at
intervals throughout the evening.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Coffee had been handed round. The men
who sauntered upstairs for a cup massed
themselves together for company at one
end of the room. If separate from their
kind, they seemed forlorn and uneasy, and
watched an opportunity to escape. One or
two of the oldest, including Major Jones, and
a Mr. Batley, who was young, but a new-comer
and unacquainted with the ways of the
house, advanced into what seemed to be
looked on as the women’s end.</p>

<p class='c015'>Miss Prudence Semaphore moved her
skirts slightly, so as to give a chance to anyone
wishing to sit beside her. No one came.
Pretty Miss Fastleigh and her sister, with
an unconsciousness born of experience, had
thoughtfully taken places as near the men
as possible. Soon they were deep in conversation
with the more courageous of the
advanced guard.</p>

<p class='c015'>Coffee over, the greater number of the
men made a stampede. Some were studying
for examinations and could not spare
time. More sat in each other’s rooms
drinking whisky and soda, others again
turned out for a game of billiards.</p>

<p class='c015'>A whist party was formed by Miss Semaphore,
her sister, Major Jones and Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Dumaresq. Mrs. Whitley, Mrs. Dumaresq,
the medical woman, Miss Belcher, Miss
Fastleigh, Mr. Batley, and his sister, took
part in a round game. Miss Primsby, a
timid girl, very proper, and easily shocked,
whose formidable mother went to bed early,
after a time slipped gently downstairs to the
smoking-room. There she taught chess to
Monsieur Lemprière, a young Frenchman
who had come over to learn the language.
The better to explain the moves, she held
his hand in hers.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In England the Garden of Beauty is kept</div>

      <div class='line'>But so oft this unamiable dragon hath slept,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That the garden’s but carelessly watched after all.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The second Miss Fastleigh, who had a
good voice, went to the piano unasked and
sang one or two songs. Finding no one took
any particular notice, she amused herself by
running up the scale and sustaining the high
A, much to the exasperation of her hearers.
The only woman who can endure scales is
the woman who is singing them. Mrs.
Belcher perused the paper. She did not
take it herself, but borrowed it from Major
Jones in the evenings. From time to time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>she gave scraps of news to Mrs. Wilcox, who
had read it all before breakfast. Captain
Wilcox sat downstairs in his wife’s office,
balancing the books.</p>

<p class='c015'>About half-past ten Miss Semaphore rose.
Having carried all before her at the whist
table, she was in high spirits, and bade good-night
with much affability to everyone except
the Belchers. She carried with her the copy
of the <cite>Lady’s Pictorial</cite>. When her sister,
having as usual sat with her for twenty
minutes, discussing the events of the day,
had retired to her own room, which adjoined,
she sat down and wrote the following letter:</p>

I do not of course know what you would consider such.
I should be glad, therefore, if you could arrange for an

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>This was enclosed in an envelope addressed
to “X. Y. Z., Office of the <cite>Lady’s

carried it herself to the post.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='large'>MISS SEMAPHORE RECEIVES AN ANSWER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“I am perfectly proportioned,” said the medical
lady confidentially to Mrs. Whitley.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Whitley would not have thought so
herself, but she made an assenting murmur,
out of politeness.</p>

<p class='c015'>They were seated at breakfast two or
three mornings later, and the medical lady’s
statement was interrupted by the entrance of
Miss Semaphore, who glided quietly to her
place, and took up her correspondence with
some appearance of anxiety.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Perfectly proportioned,” went on the
medical lady in a lower key; “my dressmaker
says she has no difficulty therefore in
fitting me, and my gowns always sit well. I
don’t say this out of vanity. It is a fact.
I fear, however, it would be no use giving
her address to other people, for the result
might not be as satisfactory.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Mrs. Whitley looked insulted, but she was
a timid woman, and not ready of speech.
She thought the medical lady’s dress clumsy,
and her figure shapeless, but had indiscreetly
asked who made it—the dress, not the figure—with
a view to employing the woman on
some plain sewing. The medical lady’s
answer to her question had offended her very
much, but she could not think of anything
cutting to say in reply.</p>

<p class='c015'>Without noticing her expression, or feeling
any awkwardness, the medical lady continued,</p>

<p class='c015'>“You know my velvet mantle? I have
been told Miss Fastleigh says she does not
like it. Now that is pure jealousy. It is an
extremely handsome mantle, far handsomer
than anything she could afford. But of
course it could only be worn by a fine,
tall woman. It is astonishing that so many
people are jealous of me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Whitley wondered vaguely what
grounds for jealousy the medical lady gave.
She certainly was not popular in the house,
but that was scarcely because anyone was
jealous of her. Belief in her own beauty,
however, and in the envy she imagined it
excited, kept her happy; so sharp speeches or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>covert hints alike failed to alter her. Mrs.
Whitley she had chosen as a confidante, under
the belief that she was a quiet little person
who admired her. She would have been
very much astonished to hear Mrs. Whitley’s
candid opinion.</p>

<p class='c015'>“And how are you this morning, Mrs.
Whitley?” asked Mrs. Dumaresq blandly.
She was the next arrival.</p>

<p class='c015'>“My cold is still bad, thank you,” said
Mrs. Whitley.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, indeed! No doubt the draught in
your room increased it. All the small rooms
here are draughty, as the doors and windows
are opposite each other. Of course, as I
have told you, when we came here we meant
to stop but a very short time. I can assure
you, my dear Mrs. Whitley, that to anyone
who has moved in diplomatic circles, and
been honoured by the gracious hospitality of
royalty, a boarding-house, however well kept—and
this is not without its good points—cannot
fail to be objectionable. Though we
meant, as I have said, to stay but a short
time, I was most particular about having a
good room. ‘Angelo,’ said I, ‘let us take
the best apartments in the house,’ and so
we did. I made a point of it. It is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>great pity that you do not move into a
larger room. Not that it makes any difference
to me. I am quite above such petty
matters. I never was influenced by any
worldly consideration in my choice of acquaintances;
far from it. If I like people,
my dear Mrs. Whitley, I like them whether
they have a small room or not. I do
assure you they may be stowed away at the
very top of the house for all I care.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Very kind of you, I’m sure,” murmured
Mrs. Whitley. The blaze of grandeur surrounding
Mr. and Mrs. Dumaresq, caused
her to take all that they said in good part.
They had a certain suavity, an easy way of
saying unpleasant things, that the medical
lady lacked. Besides, Mrs. Whitley’s one
ambition was to get into Society, and she
secretly hoped that if she was very civil to
Mrs. Dumaresq, she might possibly be one
day introduced to some of the distinguished
personages whose names were so frequently
introduced into her conversation.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes,” went on the lady in a glow of
generous feeling and a somewhat heightened
voice, “rank, and wealth, and position have
never had any charm for me. As my dear
friend, the Marchese Polichinello, a charming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>woman, a reigning beauty at the Italian
Court—You remember the Marchese,
Angelo?—often said to me, ‘<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Bellisima mia</span></i>’—she
always addressed me as ‘<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">bellisima
mia</span></i>’—‘you are led too much by your
heart.’”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I suppose you are going to the Queen’s
Garden Party, Mrs. Dumaresq,” said the
medical lady, who had been reading the
<cite>Court Circular</cite>.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, ah, yes,” replied Mrs. Dumaresq,
“I expect I shall. It is easy for me to go
at any time.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But guests must have attended a Drawing-room
within the last two years to be
eligible for invitations,” said Mr. Lorimer
gruffly, “and I thought you said you were
out of England.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Certainly, certainly,” answered Mrs.
Dumaresq, “we have of course been away,
but the dear Prince will arrange all that;
and then, practically speaking, I have
attended a Drawing-room within the last
two years.”</p>

<p class='c015'>No one asked what she meant.</p>

<p class='c015'>Meantime Miss Semaphore was reading
the following letter:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Miss Semaphore ate her breakfast pensively
and in silence, then made her way to her
room. A thousand pounds! It was a large
sum of money, a very large sum. The sisters
were fairly well off, still that was a
great deal to give out of their capital. But
if this Mrs. Geldheraus—Miss Semaphore
knew the name as that of a famous African
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>traveller of German birth—if Mrs. Geldheraus
spoke the truth, the water was well
worth it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Miss Semaphore scarcely allowed her mind
to dwell on the ecstatic delight of being once
more nineteen—intelligent nineteen this time,
nineteen conscious of its powers, knowing the
value of youth, enjoying the mere being
young as no one could who had not been old.
Had she dwelt on it, she would have felt prepared
for this one good to give not only one
thousand pounds, but her entire fortune and
count it well spent. Still, common sense
told her a thousand pounds was no trifle for
a woman of her means. She could not raise
it herself all at once.</p>

<p class='c015'>On consideration, she decided to tell her
sister, to share the bottle with her, and halve
the expense. Prudence being younger, would
naturally require less of the water. There
was no need, however, to allude to that beforehand,
else she might feel inclined to pay
only in proportion.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Misses Semaphore had had a life
similar to that of many single women—a
grey, colourless life, full of petty cares and
petty interests. Born in a country town,
where their parents were the magnates of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>dull and highly-respectable circle, they had
had a martinet father and an invalid mother.
Church work occupied the days of their
youth. Few visitors called on them except
elderly married people that they had known
all their lives. The very curates in Pillsborough
were married.</p>

<p class='c015'>Colonel Semaphore, like many retired
military men, had had strict principles, and
had taught his daughters to be suspicious of
everything that looked pleasant. Reading,
except of devotional works, had not been
encouraged in their home. Neither of
the girls had been rebellious or particularly
bright. They had tried to do their duty,
and had found it monotonous. Seeing little
of the world, and having no youthful society,
they had grown elderly, prim, and formal
without knowing it. Dreaming that their
lives were all before them, they had waked
up suddenly to find that life is youth, and
that youth was over.</p>

<p class='c015'>When their father had died at an advanced
age, they had moved to London, feeling themselves
most adventurous in making such a
change. Years had hardened Miss Augusta
and softened Miss Prudence. The former
was the terror of the giddy at Beaconsfield
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Gardens. Behind her back they made fun
of her, and imitated her precise manner, but
no one liked to come in collision with her.
Miss Prudence, soft-hearted, soft-headed, and
a little romantic, was the favourite. She
was always ready to fall in love, but lacked
opportunity. Her little airs, graces, and
stratagems were as transparent as the day.
She had difficulty in realising that she was
grown-up, and would have called anyone who
forced the truth on her “a horrid thing.”
Her strong-minded sister’s dominion over
her and her affairs tended to strengthen the
delusion. Miss Semaphore managed the
property and investments from which their
income was derived, and seldom referred to
Prudence in such matters, save when her signature
was required.</p>

<p class='c015'>Under all her severity, however, Miss
Semaphore was by no means as rigid as
she looked. Since coming to London, she
had begun half-unconsciously to contrast
the life she had led with the lives that
young women about her led. Something
stirred vaguely in her. She felt she had
been defrauded of many things that were
bright and pleasant and harmless in themselves.
How matters in the past could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>have been different she did not quite know,
but she wished they had been different. All
this was food to her desire to be young, to
have her time over again, to enjoy herself
just a little; and many of her disagreeable
speeches might have been traced, by a student
of human nature, to the bitterness towards
others that sometimes wells in the heart of a
lonely woman, making her feel, “I have had
a bad time, why should not they?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'>CASTLES IN THE AIR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>That evening, a little shamefacedly, Miss
Semaphore told Prudence how she had
answered the advertisement in <cite>The Pictorial</cite>,
and received a reply from Mrs. Geldheraus.</p>

<p class='c015'>Prudence was very much surprised and
delighted, being in one of her rare spasms of
remembrance that she no longer was a girl.
She expressed herself as not only willing but
ready and anxious to help in raising half of
the money required, if the explorer’s widow
persisted in demanding a thousand pounds.</p>

<p class='c015'>The sisters resolved, however, that Miss
Augusta should endeavour to persuade her
to accept £600, advancing to £800, and only
paying the full sum if she remained obdurate.
They decided, too, that despite her excellent
references, it would be only judicious to postdate
the cheque offered her, that they might
have an opportunity of personally testing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>efficacy of the water before the draft was
presented.</p>

<p class='c015'>“She is very emphatic as to its genuineness,”
said Miss Semaphore; “but of course
we do not know her, and she may not speak
the truth. If she is an honest person—and
certainly her references are all that can be
desired—she will be quite willing to give us
a chance of first finding out whether the
water is really any good. A thousand pounds
is a great deal of money, and we ought to
run no risks.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She says she is willing to give you a
proof before purchase.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wonder what sort of proof?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Perhaps take some herself.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I shouldn’t like that. It would be a pity
to waste any of it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I tell you what,” said Miss Semaphore,
after consideration, “I’ll take Toutou and
make her give him a little, just for an experiment.
You see he would require much less
than a human being, unless we had quite a
young girl at hand, and on her it might not
show. The poor darling is nearly fifteen.
A mere sip should suffice for him.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Perhaps it does not act on animals,”
suggested Miss Prudence.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“Why should it not? I once read something
about the Water of Youth before in a
book, and my belief is that they said it acted
not only on people, but on insects, and on
flowers; then why not on a dog?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Augusta dear! what will you do when
you are young again?” asked Prudence
softly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, lots of things,” said Miss Semaphore.
“She did not like to own, even to her sister,
the golden dreams that floated before her,
and that she felt would be slightly ridiculous
for a mature woman to confess.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How old will you be?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, if the thing can be regulated, I
should like to be about eight-and-twenty.
You see that is considered young, but not too
young. At eight-and-twenty a woman has
sense, if ever she is going to have it, and
is old enough then to know her own mind.
Eight-and-twenty, and stay at it, is my
idea.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I should like to be eighteen,” said Prudence.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Too young. At eighteen one is generally
either a fool or a pert Miss, and therefore
unattractive to the best sort of men. However,
I should not mind standing at twenty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>if that is more convenient; but I must first
find out how the water works.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Just fancy you twenty and me eighteen!
What young creatures we shall be! Oh,
Augusta dear, do you know I feel quite
frightened. What shall we do alone in
London with no one to look after us?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Miss Semaphore
crossly. “We have only to consider
our appearance. We shan’t really be so ridiculously
young, you know. I have no doubt
we shall retain our present minds and experience,
and be perfectly well able to manage
for ourselves. Of course I shall make all
enquiries to-morrow as to the effects and act
accordingly. And for goodness sake, Prudie,
if it is successful, don’t keep remembering
and talking about things that you could not
possibly have seen or known if you were
really only eighteen. That is just the sort of
stupid thing you are likely to do. We must
carefully look out the proper date and avoid
remembering anything before that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t you think, dear,” said Miss
Prudence after a pause, “it will be well to
go away from here before trying the experiment,
away to some place where we are not
known? It will be so awkward else.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>“Yes,” said Miss Semaphore reflectively,
“I suppose it would be better; but we can
consider that to-morrow, and now I am quite
tired. It is time for us both to go to bed.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The sisters duly undressed and sought
repose, but for a long time none came. The
future was too full of bewildering possibilities.
Each felt that she ought not to let her mind
dwell on what might never come to pass.
Mrs. Geldheraus might be an imposter, the
Water of Youth a fraud. Still, supposing—there
was no harm in supposing—supposing
both were genuine, what a delightful prospect.
To be at once young and experienced;
could anything surpass it? Pitfalls might
be avoided, amusement sought, courses of
conduct followed after a fashion impossible
to anyone who was eighteen or twenty for
the first and only time in life. To get all
one’s chances over again, and to be assured
of missing none of them, what luck! what
unexampled good fortune!</p>

<p class='c015'>Rosy visions of what they would do intruded
on both of them, but we grieve to
state that the wildest and flightiest of these
visions were those of the elder Miss Semaphore.
Were her eyes or those of her sister
ever to light on these lines, were there a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>chance that her acquaintances might see this
veracious history, we should hesitate to set
her fancies down, and this for two reasons.
First, because Miss Semaphore herself would
be confused and confounded to a painful
degree, and this, as she is an excellent if
somewhat hard woman, we have no wish to
bring about. Second, because her sister and
friends would write lengthy and indignant
letters denying our statements, and citing her
reputation for propriety, not to say rigidity,
of conduct, and her severely religious tone,
her want of sympathy with flightiness of any
kind, as proof positive that she never could,
would, or should have thought what we
assert was in her mind.</p>

<p class='c015'>Fortunately we need not fear either danger,
and so in all truthfulness may state
exactly what Miss Semaphore hoped to do
with her renewed youth.</p>

<p class='c015'>In her secret soul she had come to think
that it was rather a pity she had not had a
past to reflect upon. She had gathered no
roses while she might. She had been only
too well brought up, and she was determined,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en tout bien et en tout honneur</span></i> be it understood,
to change all that. Someone has said,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il n’y a aucune austerité supérieure qui ne
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>laisse pas quelques régrets</span></i>. She would try
the delights of an impeccable but more
frivolous existence. She would be fascinating,
coquettish, would avoid the misplaced
gravity of her inexperienced youth, that had
been not only afraid to enjoy itself, but had
not known how to set about it, and had never
got the chance.</p>

<p class='c015'>As a preliminary to a dazzling career of
conquest she decided that as soon as she
was twenty she would take lessons in stage
dancing and have her voice trained. Her
father, or any of the worthy inhabitants
of Pillsborough known to her, would have
fainted at mention of the stage. Indeed,
when young, Miss Semaphore shared their
views; but she had been gradually coming
round since she moved to London and found
that even amongst the Philistines “the profession”
was not in such bad odour as in the
country. She felt it to be wicked but fascinating,
believed she had genuine, if uncultivated,
dramatic talent, and actually regretted
that circumstances had kept her from cultivating
it.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now, she thought, she would not be
stopped. This goes to prove that the most
proper and severe persons often think a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>course of action suitable for themselves which
they would reprehend in others.</p>

<p class='c015'>She argued, and with truth, that dangerous
though the stage might be, she would
have the experience of over fifty years to
guide her, and would therefore be in a different
position from other girls of twenty. In a
lurid but delightful vision she saw herself
gay, beautiful, famous, the delight of the
stalls, the admiration of the gallery, the
recipient of bouquets and <em>billets-doux</em>, her
photograph in every shop window, offers of
marriage coming by every post. At last she
fell asleep, a beatific smile on her face.</p>

<p class='c015'>She had quite forgotten how two or three
years before she had brought pressure to bear
on Mrs. Wilcox to give notice to a girl who
had gone on the stage. Englishwomen are
often shocked at others doing what they
would do themselves, if they had the chance
or the aptitude.</p>

<p class='c015'>Miss Prudence meanwhile, in her little
white room adjoining, thought kindly of
Major Jones and yearningly of the Rev.
Harry Lyndon, Curate of St. Botolph’s, a
consumptive young man of twenty-eight.
She had always admired the Reverend
Harry, though reluctantly admitting in her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>heart of hearts that he was somewhat too
young for her. But now what would there
be to prevent their union? She fell into a
train of reverie as to how the matter should
be managed. Would she let him think she
had always been no more than eighteen, or
would she tell him of the wonderful water?
Sleep came to her while deliberating.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'>THE WATER OF YOUTH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Usually the fond imaginations of the night
wear a different aspect in the dawn; but the
visions of the Misses Semaphore had lost
none of their attractiveness by morning.
Though, as before said, they tried now and
then to check their super-abounding joy by
the cold reflection that perhaps the explorer’s
widow was a humbug, and the Water of
Youth liquid drawn from the nearest well,
they had much ado to keep their excitement
within bounds. Indeed their manner, despite
all efforts, betrayed such suppressed exultation
that Mr. Lorimer twice enquired of
Major Jones if he thought “the old girls”
were daft.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the afternoon, punctually as the clock
chimed a quarter to four, Miss Augusta,
neatly dressed in black, and carrying Toutou
in her arms, took her way to Gloucester Road
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Station and booked to King’s Cross, whence
she took a cab to 194, Handel Street, W.C.</p>

<p class='c015'>At about half-past six she returned.
Prudence, who had been anxiously awaiting
her, jumped up eagerly as she put her head
in at the door and said, “Come into my
room,” in a voice full of mysteries.</p>

<p class='c015'>Arrived in the centre of her own apartment
Miss Semaphore turned round and
faced her sister with much solemnity. She
spoke no word and began slowly unfastening
her bonnet string. The air seemed big
with fate.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well?” gasped Miss Prudence, “did
you see her? Is it all right? What was
she like?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Miss Semaphore was in no haste to
answer.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The Water—tell me quick, was it any
good. Did you buy it?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Look,” said Miss Semaphore with a wave
of her hand.</p>

<p class='c015'>The eyes of Miss Prudence followed the
gesture and fell on Toutou. But was it
Toutou, this transformed dog? Old, shaky,
querulous, rheumatic Toutou? She went
nearer. There was a jolly, bright-eyed little
beast, a mere puppy, slim, young, and frisky,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>without a grey hair in his coat, who suddenly
leaped on Prudence, barking and jumping
round with lively manifestations of delight.</p>

<p class='c015'>“She tested it on him,” said Miss Augusta
in a hollow voice, “and see the result. Can
we doubt its miraculous power any longer?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Miss Prudence sat down, looking quite
pale and awe-stricken. This proof overwhelmed
her.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I am almost afraid of it,” she gasped. “It
does not seem right somehow, does it?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, nonsense,” exclaimed Miss Augusta
pettishly. “Not right? Of course it is.
For my part I think it a most glorious and
beneficent discovery, and not calculated to
harm anyone.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Did she give much to Toutou? Do tell
me all that happened. Was she nice?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, she was very nice indeed, a well-bred,
good-looking woman. The house was
not much to look at, and the servant so untidy;
but Mrs. Geldheraus told me she had
only taken apartments there temporarily, as
she is leaving almost immediately for the
continent. Her boxes are packed.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Does she look young herself?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“About twenty-three; but she assures me
she is sixty-four. I could not believe it. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>showed me her baptismal certificate. It was
in German, so I could not make much out of
it; but I saw the date eighteen hundred and
thirty something quite plainly.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Good gracious!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She was ever so civil, and insisted on
giving me tea, but she would make no reduction
in her terms. She said she knew she
was asking what would be a good deal of
money for an ordinary cosmetic, but for an
absolute return to youth it was ridiculously
little. Many dying millionaires or monarchs
would be willing to give all their possessions
for even a few drops of it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And then?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then I spoke of requiring some proof that
it was as efficacious as she said, so she offered
to give me a little then and there. I was
rather afraid to risk it, and said I’d prefer
her to give some to Toutou first, but that
she should not charge extra for that, as it
was simply experimental. She agreed, and
poured about half a tea-spoonful into a
saucer, mixed some milk with it, and made
Toutou drink it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And did he change at once?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, he just came back in his slow, fat
way, and lay down before the fire wheezing;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>but she bade me watch him closely, and
gradually I saw one by one the white patches
dying out of his coat. Those that came last
went first. Then I noticed that he breathed
more freely, you know he was not asthmatic
until two years ago. By degrees he grew
thinner, his coat glossier, and his eyes less
dim; then suddenly he sprang up and began
dashing round the room in wild spirits, just
as he used to. After this I could doubt no
longer. Still, I told her our idea about post-dating
the cheque, hoped she would not be
offended and all that, but I had yet to prove
if the Water would work as efficaciously on
human beings as on an animal.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And did she agree?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, she did not like the notion at all;
said she had given me a positive demonstration,
and so on, which ought to satisfy me, but
I insisted. She then said she wanted the
money pressingly and at once, that this was
the only reason why she let us have it, and
made what really was for her a bad bargain.
The end of it was she agreed to my post-dating
the cheque two days, if I promised in
the interval to take a dose of the liquid that
would satisfy me there was truth in what she
said, so I consented to take just a little as a
preliminary, to-night.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“Oh,—will you really? Don’t you think
it might be better to go away from here
first and try it somewhere down in the
country, as we agreed. They will be sure
to remark so on any sudden change in you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I hope,” said Miss Augusta with severity
and dignity, “you do not mean to say I look
so old that the taking off of a few years will
make a very visible difference. I am quite
aware I may not look as young as I once did,
but that this is so very perceptible as you
seem to imply, I really do not believe.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh no! of course not. I did not exactly
mean that,” murmured Miss Prudence.</p>

<p class='c015'>She had meant it, however, so found it
difficult to explain away her words. One
generally does find it difficult under such
circumstances.</p>

<p class='c015'>Miss Augusta, taking no further notice,
proceeded to lock the precious bottle into a
drawer, and had scarcely done so when the
dinner bell rang.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Good gracious!” exclaimed Prudence,
“I must run and dress.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She hastily opened the door of her room,
but the frisky Toutou was too quick for her.
He darted forward and almost upset her in
his eagerness to get out.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“How lively he is!” said Prudence in
admiration. “Just like a puppy! How did
you get him home if he danced about like
this?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It was a troublesome business I assure
you,” answered Miss Augusta, who was
too much interested and excited to sulk
long with her sister. “He jumped out of
my arms and frisked up and down the
carriage in the liveliest way, so that I had
the greatest difficulty in catching him again.
He was in the wildest state of delight you
can imagine, barked and leaped on all the
passengers, just fancy, and he has been so
rheumatic for years! I could scarcely hold
him under my cloak. He sprang out of my
arms once and very nearly broke the bottle
I was carrying.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How dreadful! What on earth should
we have done if he had smashed it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, fortunately he didn’t,” said Miss
Augusta shortly, refusing to contemplate
such a calamity.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <span class='large'>AN ACCIDENT AND ITS RESULTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>With ill-concealed impatience did Miss
Semaphore await her usual hour for retiring.
With a sense of agreeable expectancy did
she at last seat herself in her room before
the looking-glass and proceed to brush out
her scanty tresses. In the open drawer of
the table reposed the abundant coils that
graced by day the back of her head. As
she brushed, she reflected that expensive
though the Water of Youth undoubtedly
was, it would at any rate spare her buying
“Jetoline,” her favourite dye, for many years
to come. Women, guilty of a great extravagance,
always find comfort in meditating
small economies.</p>

<p class='c015'>Her thoughts next turned to Toutou, and
his marvellous recovery of vigour and gaiety.
She wondered if her spirits would become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>as light as his. As a girl she had not been
particularly lively, but she hoped in her
second girlhood her sprightlier and more
freakish qualities might develop.</p>

<p class='c015'>While thus reflecting, her door opened,
and in came Miss Prudence to bid her good-night.
Prudence, as we have said, was a
large, soft woman, whose kindly, if feeble,
nature and unruffled temper tended to preserve
her youthful roundness. In her white
combing jacket, her cheeks flushed, and her
still abundant nut-brown hair falling on her
shoulders, she seemed to her sister to look
particularly young. To be sure, there was
ten years difference or more in their ages,
and Miss Semaphore was always accustomed
to look on Prudence as a mere girl, but even
allowing for this, to-night she might have
passed for thirty.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think, dear,” she said, “you really
ought to put off that dose for a day or two.
We might go to Ramsgate to-morrow and
engage apartments, then, if you liked, we
need not return here. I could come back
and fetch the luggage, if you gave Mrs.
Wilcox a week’s notice; she would never
suspect anything. We can pretend we want
change of air.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“I do wish you were not so silly, Prudence,”
said Miss Semaphore with acerbity.
“Do you forget that I post-dated the cheque
for that woman to allow of my experimenting
to-night, and she wants the money immediately.
Anyone but you would see that
once she has cashed it, we cannot get it back,
whether the Water proves to be any good
or not. It is essential to test it at once, and
stop payment of the draft, if necessary.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But they talk so here, I am afraid—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, really you are very rude. This
is the second time you have said something
like that. To hear your tone one might
think I was a hundred at least. Oh! I
know very well what you mean. It is all
part of your ridiculous fussiness. It will
make very little difference. The dose is
one tablespoonful for every ten years, and
having reached the proper age, a tea-spoonful
at intervals keeps one at it. Now to-night
I shall take very, very little, just enough to
take off a year or two, so you may make
yourself quite easy. No one will see any
difference.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I wonder if it tastes bad,” said Prudence,
after a short silence.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not at all,” said Miss Semaphore more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>graciously, “I have already dipped my finger
in and laid a drop upon my tongue, and
it tasted just like common water.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“There can be no doubt but that it is
real?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Look at Toutou,” was the convincing
answer.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do you know I’m a little bit afraid of it,”
said Miss Prudence. “I wonder how it will
feel, will it make one very queer or not.
Don’t think me selfish, Augusta, but I’m
glad you are going to try it first, you have so
much more courage than I.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Miss Semaphore merely grunted in reply.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where is the bottle, Augusta?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“In my drawer.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It does not hold so very much,” said
Prudence, meditatively lifting the bottle to
the light.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It does not, and oh! of course I shall
require more than you, being older.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But I paid for half,” said Prudence
mildly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Even so, it is quite fair. Less than half
will have as much effect on you as the rest
on me. We shall then be both of an age,
and that will be much pleasanter. Don’t you
think so?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“Ye—es,” answered Prudence doubtfully,
“it will be a little strange. But do as you
wish about it, Augusta; you know best.
By the way, did you remark that the bottle
is cracked?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Cracked? No!” cried Miss Semaphore
with a little shriek of dismay, and rushing to
her sister’s side.</p>

<p class='c015'>Cracked it undoubtedly was.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It must have been Toutou in the train,”
she gasped. “I was afraid of it at the time.
Oh! the naughty, naughty dog. Do be careful,
Prudence. Put it down softly. She
said it was to be kept carefully corked.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, the crack is very slight; it does not
matter,” said Miss Prudence, as she obeyed.
“Toutou, my precious,” to the tricksy little
dog that was now rolling on the floor, playing
with the fringe of the curtains, and trying
many long-forgotten games. “Toutou, you
nearly did serious damage to your missus’s
property, naughty ducksie wucksie.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Toutou rushed at her with enthusiasm,
and was with difficulty persuaded to enter
his basket. Then Miss Prudence, with a
portentous yawn, bade her sister good-night,
and opened the door into the adjoining
room.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Left alone, Miss Semaphore slowly divested
herself of her wearing apparel, donned her
night-gear, and tied on the night-cap of her
youth, adhered to despite change of fashion.
Notwithstanding the confidence of her manner
to her sister, she was secretly a little nervous,
now that she was actually to make the experiment.
Her spirits went up and down like a
see-saw. At one moment she saw herself
surrounded by admirers, singing, dancing,
with fresh, unwrinkled complexion, bright
colour, dark curly hair innocent of “Jetoline.”
A ravishing picture. Again she felt like a
patient at a dentist’s about to take gas for the
first time. What would it be like. Oh, if
only Toutou, if only anyone who had tried
it could tell her exactly how it felt. Would
she lose consciousness or feel pain? Might
it not possibly kill her? By this time she
had worked herself to a state of intolerable
nervousness. She got into bed, and, sitting
up, hugging the precious bottle in one hand,
and a tea-spoon in the other, tried to decide
whether she would actually make the experiment
or not. By her bed, within easy reach,
burned a gas jet, which she always turned
out last thing, and a small table stood near,
on which lay a book, a newspaper, a box of
matches, and a glass.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>“Just a very little,” she murmured, “that
can do no harm. Only make me a few years
younger. She would never have ventured to
give me anything dangerous or poisonous.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Her hands trembled.</p>

<p class='c015'>Can one fancy the impatience of an old
woman who had missed the joys of life, to
be young? A woman with the means in her
grasp? Miss Semaphore panted with excitement;
her heart thumped like a steam
hammer. Twice she took up the bottle from
the table. Twice she laid it down again.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Just a very little,” ran her thoughts, “a
few drops to see what it is like.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Alas for her nervousness! By some untoward
movement the frill of her sleeve caught
the bottle, and knocked it over. For one
terrible moment she sat as if petrified, watching
the Water of Youth flowing across the
table, and dribbling on to the floor on the side
farthest from her. Then, quick as lightning,
she jumped out of her bed, got down on her
knees, and received the little stream into her
open mouth as the liquid gushed over the
edge. That her position was undignified did
not trouble her, did not even enter her mind.
The overwhelming nature of the misfortune,
and how to rectify it, as far as possible, alone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>occupied her. The bottle had broken in
half where it was cracked, so that the contents
rushed out at once. She swallowed all
that flowed freely, and, damming the rest
with her finger, stood up. The Water was
horribly wasted. Some had soaked into the
carpet. The newspaper had received a certain
amount, and this, owing to a lucky
crease, formed a little pool on its surface.
Now, for the first time, Miss Semaphore
thought of her sister, whose money had been
equally invested in the purchase. Should
she call Prudence, tell her what had happened,
and bid her drink the little that remained?
The fear that there would not be enough
for herself prevailed, and stifling the voice of
conscience, Augusta gathered up the paper
with delicate fingers, carefully made it into
a sort of funnel, and drank off its contents.
Then she sat down on the side of the bed, and
considered her conduct with a certain amount
of shame, not unmingled with alarm. So far,
she felt nothing more than the sensation of
having swallowed a quantity of cold water of
peculiar flavour.</p>

<p class='c015'>“After all,” she said, to stifle her remorse,
“there was scarcely sufficient to make one
person young, not to speak of two, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>wanted it much more than Prudence. Why,
she does not want it at all! She looked quite
a girl just now. Besides, there really was no
time. Before I could have roused her and
explained matters the water would have
soaked through the paper. Of course I shall
have to return her the money she advanced.
I am quite willing to do that if she makes a
fuss. Perhaps it’s just as well I did not call
her. She was frightened to-night at the idea
of drinking it. I really think she would
prefer not to have any.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Despite these powerful arguments Miss
Semaphore felt rather mean as she crept
once more between the sheets, and turned
out the gas with a jerk. For a long time
she lay wakeful, thinking of what the morrow
might bring, of how she could tell Prudence
there was no Water of Youth left for her,
or of how she could best get away from
Beaconsfield Gardens without being noticed,
if she found herself only twenty, and other
reflections of the same kind, until at last tired
out by the excitements of the day she fell
asleep.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <span class='large'>PRUDENCE RECEIVES A SHOCK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Miss Prudence Semaphore slept placidly. It
was her nature to do everything as placidly
as possible. Nightmares rarely visited her.
When Miss Augusta was crosser than usual,
or the latest man at 37, Beaconsfield Gardens,
on whom she tried to fix her easy affections,
showed that he had no thought of her, she
sometimes wept herself to sleep. Seldom,
however, did she experience the discomfort of
a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nuit blanche</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c015'>On this particular occasion she dreamt that
she was flying through space to Florida in
search of the Fountain of Youth. Suddenly
her wings failed her. She fell like another
Icarus down, down, down, awaking with a
start and a stifled gasp. She sat bolt
upright in bed, and tried to think where she
was. The familiar room dimly seen, the
light of the street lamps, filtering through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>the Venetian blinds, the sound of passing
cabs, a neighbouring clock chiming three,
all reassured her.</p>

<p class='c015'>With a sigh of relief she turned over to
sleep again, when a weird wailing attracted
her attention. Miss Prudence listened. Her
heart beat fast. The wailing seemed close
at hand. Did it come from above or
below? Noises are proverbially difficult to
locate. Miss Prudence subscribed to “Borderland,”
and a thousand unpleasant conjectures
assailed her. There was something
unearthly, she fancied, in the cry, and though
she muttered “ridiculous,” the exclamation
did not entirely restore her presence of mind.
So far, indeed, was the idea from being really
ridiculous to her, that, as the sound continued
to rise and fall feebly, Miss Prudence lay
back in bed, and pulled the clothes over
her head. She could not be happy thus,
however. Half suffocated, she emerged
from time to time to hear if it still continued.
When at last it ceased, somewhat tranquillised
by the silence, she pulled down the blankets
and began to consider what the cause of
disturbance could possibly be.</p>

<p class='c015'>A solution flashed through her mind—the
kitten! She remembered suddenly that Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Dumaresq had lately complained of a pet
kitten that played about the house having
strayed into her room, and been locked up
accidentally in the wardrobe.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The very thing! It must be the kitten,”
thought Miss Prudence.</p>

<p class='c015'>The wail, after a short interval, was
renewed, and this time Miss Prudence distinctly
recognised the cry of a young cat.</p>

<p class='c015'>Full of courage she jumped out of bed,
struck a light, put on her dressing-gown and
slippers, and began to search for pussy.</p>

<p class='c015'>She tried the wardrobe, the chest of
drawers, looked under the bed and up the
chimney, but in vain. The creature was
not to be found. As she passed the door
communicating with her sister’s room, it
seemed to her that the sound came from
there.</p>

<p class='c015'>She opened the door softly, and shading
the light with one hand, gently called “puss,
puss, puss.” Nothing came. The cry, however,
sounded distinctly nearer, louder, and
more human.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Augusta! what is that noise? Augusta!
are you awake?” said Miss Prudence with
renewed alarm.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was no answer but a prolonged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>wail. Really frightened, Prudence advanced
into the room, holding the candle above her
head. All was as she had left it, except,
except—Where was Augusta? The bed was
empty. The room was empty. Filled with
an indefinable terror, Prudence advanced to
her sister’s bedside. Oh! horror! Augusta
was gone, and in her place lay—what? A
little, shrivelled, red-faced baby, wailing
feebly, a huge night-cap fallen back off its
bald head, a woman’s night-dress lying round
it in folds a world too wide.</p>

<p class='c015'>“My God!” exclaimed poor Prudence,
“what on earth is this? Am I going mad?
Where is Augusta?” Her distracted glance
lighted on the broken bottle, and a sudden
gleam of intelligence lit up her brain. “Are
you Augusta?” she cried to the baby. The
tearful baby seemed to make a desperate
but ineffectual effort to speak. It appeared
to be on the brink of convulsions. There
was intelligence in its eye, however, and
her worst fears confirmed, poor Prudence
dropped the candlestick on her toes, and
went into violent hysterics.</p>

<p class='c015'>Fortunately for her, the room was at the
end of a passage, removed from the other
sleeping apartments by an intervening bath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>room. Underneath it was the now empty
drawing-room, while overhead reposed the
deaf Mrs. Belcher. Thus and thus alone
did her shrieks fail to rouse the household.
Every now and then she made an effort
at self-control, but again and again the
grotesque horror of the situation overcame
her.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was dawn before she pulled herself
together and faced her position. With reflection
came a burst of anger most unusual to
the placid woman.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Augusta,” she said sternly to the baby,
which had ceased weeping, as if frightened
at its sister’s distress. “Augusta, do you
understand me?”</p>

<p class='c015'>The baby apparently tried to nod.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Can’t you speak?”</p>

<p class='c015'>The baby shook its head.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It is no use, I suppose, in that case, asking
how this terrible misfortune has come
about?”</p>

<p class='c015'>The baby blinked speechlessly. It was not
an engaging child. To Prudence, much as
she loved her sister, it seemed strange and
absolutely hateful.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You little wretch!” she cried, over-mastered
by her rising anger. “Don’t you see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>the horrible position you have placed us
both in? You took too much. You must
have been a nasty, greedy, selfish, foolish
thing to have swallowed up all that water,
or this would never have happened. Are
you really my sister? How can I prove
it? Who will believe me? Perhaps the
next thing will be that I shall be hanged
for having murdered her.” At this thought
Prudence was for a moment on the verge
of fresh hysterics.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What on earth am I to do? There you
are, a baby to all intents and purposes. My
good gracious! what on earth shall I do with
you? I cannot keep you in this house. How
can I explain? They won’t believe me—why,
I wouldn’t believe it myself if anyone
told me. How shall I account for your
disappearance? and you can’t even speak to
back me up if I tell the truth. Not you!
You’d see me hanged and never say a word”—which
was unjust, considering poor Augusta
was not able to speak. Lashing herself to
fury, Prudence paced up and down the
room, wringing her hands.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Augusta! I always was a good sister to
you, and bore with your tempers, and divided
everything with you; but now, you horrid,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>selfish, ugly little thing, I declare I hate
you. I’ll just wrap you up in a shawl, and
drop you somewhere. Oh, you lit—tle
wr—r—retch, I should like to shake you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Suiting the action to the word, Prudence
pounced on the baby, and shook it till its big
cap fell quite off, and its head wobbled.</p>

<p class='c015'>Augusta was terrified, and began to howl
lustily. She was so small, so helpless, that a
certain revulsion of pity came over Prudence.
She ceased shaking, and tried to soothe her.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There now! there now!” she exclaimed,
exactly as if speaking to a real baby, “don’t
cry. I’ll see what can be done. I suppose
you took an overdose. Will you try and put
up your hand if you did?”</p>

<p class='c015'>The baby put up its hand.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Does it hurt? do you feel bad?”</p>

<p class='c015'>The baby shook its bald head, and made
an ineffectual attempt to demonstrate that
its sufferings were chiefly mental.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now will you just be quiet and cease
crying, and let me think it all over. Try
to go to sleep if you can. Perhaps some
of it may wear off, and you’ll be bigger by
and bye.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Tucking the baby up in bed, Prudence
began restlessly to pace the room, pausing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>now and again to look at the queer little
creature that had plunged her into such
unexpected difficulties. In despair she thrust
her hands into her hair, and gnawed at her
fingers. Finally she flung herself into a
chair by the window, and, staring blankly
into the street, tried to devise some means
out of her dilemma. The more she thought
of it, the more serious and unpleasant did it
appear. How Augusta could have been so
foolish as to finish the contents of the bottle,
how the bottle itself came to be broken, she
could only imagine. The result at any rate
was sufficiently deplorable. Her sister had
not stopped at eight-and-thirty, nor eight-and-twenty,
nor even eighteen, as would have
been natural and delightful, but had gone at
a bound to about eight days old.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What a mercy,” thought Prudence, kind-hearted
in the midst of her anger and perplexity,
“what a mercy that there were not
a few drops more, or what would have become
of her!”</p>

<p class='c015'>After long cogitation the lady who had
hitherto been the younger Miss Semaphore
rose, went into her own room, dressed, bathed
her swollen eyelids, and smoothed her hair.
Then she returned to her sister’s bedside.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Augusta was wide awake, but she had
ceased crying. It was only by her eyes, big
with intelligence, and looking weird and
uncanny in her ugly little red face, that
Prudence saw reason still reigned within her
diminished body, A “queer child,” a “fairy
changeling,” an “elfish infant,” would be the
terms applied to Miss Semaphore by anyone
not in the secret of her rejuvenescence.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Augusta,” said Prudence solemnly, “I
have thought it all out. Immediately after
breakfast I will go in search of this Mrs.
Geldheraus, and see if she cannot provide
you with some—some antidote for this horrible
state of things. If she cannot, I don’t
know what will become of you. It is no use
telling the truth to the people in this house.
In the first place it would be a very disagreeable
matter to go into, and make us seem
very ridiculous. In the second they would
not believe me. My only chance, if I don’t
succeed in getting something to cure you, is
to tell them to-day that you have had a letter
summoning you to the country on important
business. I shall make excuses later for your
having had to hurry off to catch a train without
saying good-bye to anyone. Meantime I
must hide you here somewhere in this room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>or in mine until to-night, and knowing how
much depends on it, I do implore you to be
quiet and not cry. If Mrs. Geldheraus fails
me, I shall enquire everywhere for some
good, kind woman who will take care of you
till you grow a little older, for of course you
must see how impossible it would be for me
to go about with a baby of your age. This
evening, after dinner, when it is dark, I will
try to smuggle you out unobserved to the
woman, if I can find one suitable, then give
warning, and go to some quiet place where
nobody knows us, and where I can perhaps
have you back to live with me. Now what
do you think of my plan? Do you like it?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Augusta evidently did not, for she shook
her head as vehemently as she could.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well,” said Prudence crossly, “if you
don’t you needn’t. I can think of nothing
better, and you are not able to give me much
help or advice. You have only yourself to
thank for having brought all this trouble on
us. I’m sure I never was so worried in my
life.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Augusta was perforce silent, but her eyes
followed every movement of her sister.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now,” continued Prudence, as the breakfast
gong sounded, “I must go downstairs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>I shall say you have had a bad night, and
desire no breakfast. I shall lock the door of
your room so that the housemaid may not
come in, and shall bring you up a cup of
milk. I suppose that is the proper thing
for you. Can you eat anything solid?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Augusta showed two rows of toothless
gums. Milk evidently should be her diet.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, for goodness’ sake keep quiet. I
will come back as soon as I possibly
can,” and with this farewell, Miss Prudence
descended. Alas! poor woman, dark as
were her forebodings, she little knew what
was to be faced, nor how difficult she
would find the execution of her simple and
excellent plan for the temporary concealment
of Augusta.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='large'>A CAREER OF DECEPTION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Never did a placid, good-natured woman,
habitually truthful, unaccustomed to all save
the shallowest of plots, unused to taking the
initiative, and indeed, preferring to depend on
the advice of others, find herself in a more unpleasant
predicament than did Miss Prudence
Semaphore. That her dilemma originated
in no fault of her own, served in no wise to
console her. To a certain extent she rose to
the situation and decided, with a promptitude
that for her was marvellous, on a course of
action, but she longed for some friendly soul
to whom she could tell her difficulties, and
whose counsel she could seek. Happily,
perhaps, for the keeping of her secret, she
had to bear her own burden in silence, and
take all the responsibility on her own weak
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c015'>A very pale and tremulous Miss Prudence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>appeared at the breakfast table on the morning
of the tragedy related in our last chapter.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Dear, dear! How ill you look!” was
the medical lady’s cheerful greeting. “Have
you had a bad night?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Miss Prudence admitted that she had.</p>

<p class='c015'>“And your sister?—How late she is
to-day. She is generally one of the first
down.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She is not very well this morning, and I
persuaded her to stay in bed,” said Prudence,
colouring to the eyes, as she embarked on her
career of falsehood.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Very wise of you; she had much better
breakfast in her room if she is feeling ill.
There is some nice kedgeree she might like.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Thank you,” said Prudence with embarrassment.
“Do not mind it. She told me
she would take no breakfast, but I said I
would bring her up a cup of milk and make
her drink it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“One of her bilious attacks, no doubt,
since she refuses to eat,” said the medical
lady.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, yes,” assented Miss Prudence
eagerly. “That is what it is—a bad
bilious attack.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do you think then,” asked the medical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>lady severely, “that it is wise of you to give
her milk?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, yes!” said poor Miss Prudence
“She likes it—it is good for her—she takes
nothing else.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Indeed!” said the medical lady, helping
herself to potted sardines. “That is very
singular for a bilious subject, but no doubt
you know best.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Does Miss Semaphore often suffer from
these unpleasant attacks?” asked Mrs.
Whitley.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No,” said Prudence. “Never—that is to
say—yes—frequently.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Whitley looked astonished, as well
she might, and Prudence, to avoid further
cross-examination, began to read the paper
upside down. The paper, unfortunately, belonged
to Mr. Lorimer, and was one of the
points whereon he was touchy. He could not
bear anyone to look at it unless specially
invited thereto by him. Presently the
abstracted Prudence became aware that an
angry altercation was in progress, between
her neighbour and Müller.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Müller!” he growled.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Blease?” said Müller enquiringly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where the devil have you put <cite>The
Standard</cite>?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Mrs. Whitley prepared to look shocked at
such language, but first glanced at Mrs.
Dumaresq, from whom she took her cue.
Mrs. Dumaresq, however, only smiled slightly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I left it dere,” said Müller.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But you didn’t. If you had it would be
here now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I—I believe I have it,” stammered
Prudence, suddenly awaking to what was
going on.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, you have, have you?” said Mr.
Lorimer crossly, taking it without a word of
apology from her outstretched hand. “I do
not provide papers for the benefit of this
establishment.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It is more blessed to give than to
receive,” put in Mrs. Whitley archly, with
the sweet smile of the peacemaker.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No doubt, ma’am,” replied Mr. Lorimer
savagely, “but it’s a good deal more expensive,”
and he became absorbed in the
columns of his oracle.</p>

<p class='c015'>The ladies exchanged glances. The
subject of Mr. Lorimer and his paper was a
standing joke in the house, and Mrs. Whitley
whispered to Prudence not to mind him, it
was “only his way.” Prudence, indeed, poor
woman, was too much occupied with her own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>troubles to take the young man’s rudeness to
heart, and after passing a few minutes in
breaking her toast and sipping her tea, she
felt justified in rising from table. She took a
cup of milk with her and departed, watched
by the medical lady, who shook her head.</p>

<p class='c015'>The younger Miss Semaphore found her
sister rolling her eyes in the most alarming
fashion.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What is the matter?” she asked, but
Augusta of course was unable to tell. She
fixed an angry glance, however, on the door
of her sister’s room and nodded towards it.
Something in that direction was evidently the
cause of her displeasure. As a matter of fact
she had had a fright. While Prudence was
downstairs, one of the housemaids, not knowing
that anyone was there, made an attempt
to get in, and as the lock on that particular
door was shaky, Miss Semaphore expected
every moment to see the girl enter the room.
She could not explain this, so had to content
herself with looking cross.</p>

<p class='c015'>Prudence pulled the curtains, moved a
number of things, saying each time, “Is it
this?” “Is it that?” but failing naturally, to
get a reply, she gave up the attempt and
began to feed her sister. The operation was
not successful.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Prudence proved but an awkward nurse.
Augusta being, in body at least, practically but
eight days old, choked, cried, and had to be
patted on the back when she got too large a
spoonful of milk. Half the contents of the
cup went the wrong way. Augusta kicked,
and spilt a portion on the carpet, but at last
the meal was got through, though with
little satisfaction to either sister.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now,” said Prudence, as she finished her
task, “I shall have to leave you alone for
some time.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Augusta evidently disliked the idea of
being left alone, for she immediately screwed
up her face into contortions that announced
an outburst of weeping.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, stop! do stop!” cried her sister
exasperated, “they are sure to hear you
if you cry. How inconsiderate you are!
For goodness sake do be quiet and think
a little of someone beside yourself. What
else am I to do? It is all very well
for you to object, but something must be
done and done quickly, and as you cannot
help me, I must decide for myself. I shall
go at once to Mrs. Geldheraus and implore
of her to give me something to cure you.
She is sure to know what should be done,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>and in the meantime I beg of you keep quiet,
or Mary will hear you in the corridor. I
shall tell her you are ill and on no account to
be disturbed.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Augusta apparently listened to reason, for
gradually her features relaxed and she ceased
whimpering. Prudence put on her bonnet,
veil, and mantle, tucked in the elderly infant,
locked the doors carefully, warned Mary, and
started off to find the explorer’s widow.</p>

<p class='c015'>The poor lady’s mind was a chaos of conflicting
thought and emotions as she wound
her way through the Bloomsbury squares to
Handel Street. No. 194 was gaunt and
dingy. Over the door hung a framed card,
bearing the legend, “Apartments,” and on the
sill of the dining-room window sat a black
cat, lazily washing herself in the sun. In
answer to repeated ringing, a dirty servant,
with her cap all to one side, opened the door.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Mrs. Geldheraus,” she said, “she ain’t
here. Left this morning first thing, she did.
Had a tellygram last night to hurry up.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Prudence never knew till that moment
when her heart sank heavy as lead, how hope
had buoyed her up.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where has she gone to?” she asked
feebly. “Will she return?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“She’s gone to Paris,” said the maid, “an’
I don’t think she’s a-coming back.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Can you give me her address in Paris?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She wrote something out for missus, as
to where letters was to be sent for her. If
you’ll step in an’ wait a bit, mum, I’ll see if I
can get it for you. I can’t read them furrin
names.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Prudence stepped into the stuffy hall and
waited.</p>

<p class='c015'>Presently the maid returned with a halfsheet
of note-paper, on which only the
words “Poste Restante, Paris,” were written.
Bitterly disappointed the younger Miss
Semaphore turned away.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Even if I write to her,” she said to herself,
“it will mean a couple of days delay at
the very least, and great Heaven! what
should I do if anyone saw Augusta in the
meantime? I must see to some place for her
at once, and get her out of that house.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The very weakest women, when forced
into a position of danger and responsibility,
will act with a certain energy, and will display
a resourcefulness that surprises no one more
than it surprises themselves. Necessity is a
hard taskmaster, who makes people capable
of feats hitherto undreamt of by them.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Miss Semaphore’s first move, therefore, was
to find a small stationer’s shop, where she
obtained permission to write a letter. The
letter was to Mrs. Geldheraus, marked
“Urgent and Private.” In it she detailed
the horrible accident that had happened to
her sister, and implored the explorer’s widow
to write or wire particulars of an antidote, if
there was one, and in all cases to let her
know exactly how the Water of Youth
worked, and how long its effects were likely
to last in such a case. She said, “You can
imagine the dreadful position in which I am
placed. My sister is altered out of knowledge;
though she still seems, so far as I
can judge, to preserve her memory and understanding,
she cannot speak. You have
left England, and the story sounds so improbable,
that I cannot hope any of our
friends would believe me if I told them the
truth. I live in terror of my sister being
discovered under her present aspect, so
implore you to lose no time in relieving my
suspense.”</p>

<p class='c015'>This she posted, but the most gloomy
apprehensions assailed her.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Mrs. Geldheraus may not call for letters
for a week,” she reflected, “and where on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>earth can I hide Augusta? Who will take
her? What story can I tell about her?
It is distracting!”</p>

<p class='c015'>By degrees she grew a little calmer. It
would not be difficult, she hoped, to find some
decent woman to mind her sister at her own
home. Surely there were plenty of people
in London willing to take care of a child.
She would enquire. Meantime it struck her
that Augusta looked ridiculous in her great
night-dress and cap, so that before placing
her in the hands of any stranger it would be
necessary to buy her a complete set of baby
linen.</p>

<p class='c015'>To this end, having walked to the top of
Tottenham Court Road she hailed a hansom,
and drove to Westbourne Grove.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class='large'>A PROMISING ADVERTISEMENT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>With no little diffidence did Miss Prudence
Semaphore, a woman quite unused to the
ways and wants of babies, present herself at
the special counter in Whiteley’s devoted to
their needs, and falter out that she required
a complete outfit for an infant. The attendant
who waited on her considered that she
had a most extraordinary customer to deal
with, for the lady neither knew the age of
the child nor the names and quantities of the
needful garments, and when she finally took
everything that was suggested to her, she
required instruction as to how and in what
order the various articles were to be put on.
Having requested that a parcel of the most
indispensable objects should be given to her,
and that the remainder should be delivered
that afternoon at 37, Beaconsfield Gardens,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>the next step for Miss Prudence was to find
a nurse who would undertake the care of
Augusta. This at once landed her in difficulties.
She first thought of appealing to
the shop-woman, but the manner of that
superior young person was so lofty that the
words died on Miss Semaphore’s lips. The
Universal Provider certainly did not provide
homes for infants. Prudence dared not ask
any of her acquaintances as to a suitable
person, yet could not imagine how else she
was to get one. She could not seize the
first respectable-looking body that passed by
and ask her would she mind an infant. Like
a woman with a guilty secret she wandered
up and down the Grove, looking vaguely
into shop windows but seeing nothing, and
wondering all the time what she was to
do. It seemed almost as desperate an
undertaking to get rid of a baby as to get
rid of a corpse.</p>

<p class='c015'>At last the idea struck her that the
laundress who washed for herself and her
sister might know of someone suitable. Mrs.
Robbins lived at Hammersmith, and Miss
Prudence, hailing an omnibus going in that
direction, got in. If Mrs. Robbins could not
help her, what was she to do? As she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>journeyed on, however, doubts as to the
wisdom of consulting Mrs. Robbins assailed
her. She would put herself, to a certain
extent, in the woman’s power, and the civilest
of laundresses might not be pleasant as a
<em>confidante</em>. Again, Mrs. Robbins might gossip
with the servants at Beaconsfield Gardens,
and as Miss Semaphore’s one aim was to
avoid the tongues of her fellow-boarders, she
felt the risk to be too great.</p>

<p class='c015'>Accordingly, though she had paid her fare
to Hammersmith Broadway, she presently
signalled to the conductor to set her down.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We ain’t there yet, mum,” said that
functionary. “You sed ’Ammersmith.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No matter, no matter,” answered Miss
Prudence, “I wish to be set down here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The man obeyed, and the lady was left
standing on the pathway, considering what
she should do next.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mechanically she turned down a side
street, and noticed at the door of a clean-looking
house a chubby-faced, bright young
woman, nursing a baby. Summoning up all
her courage, Miss Semaphore approached
her, and with unconscious diplomacy remarked,</p>

<p class='c015'>“What a very fine child! Is it yours?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>“Yes ’m,” replied the beaming mother.
“My third ’e is, just six months old, bless ’is
little ’eart; but ’e ain’t looking well now, not
’e, ’e’s teething, and that do so pull a hinfant
down.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“He is a beauty,” said Miss Prudence.
“Should you be disposed to undertake the
care of another child—a—a little younger, if
you were well paid for it?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No ’m, that I shouldn’t,” said the young
woman promptly. “My own three is enough
for me, an’ my old man I know he wouldn’t
like it, nohow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Could you recommend any careful,
respectable woman who would?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I can’t say as I do. Ain’t the child’s
parents living, or is it yer own?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, no!” said Miss Prudence, blushing
to the eyes, “the child is an orphan.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Poor little thing. Sorry I carn’t ’elp you,
’m, but I don’t know a suitable party.”</p>

<p class='c015'>A second application, this to a decent-looking
body who was sweeping out a particularly
dingy chapel, met with no better success.</p>

<p class='c015'>A third woman did know of someone
whose child had died and who might, perhaps,
be willing to care for a baby, but on looking
for the street where the person was said to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>live, Miss Semaphore found that some mistake
had been made in the address, and that
no one knew of any such place. The people
she asked made various suggestions as to
where she should go, and she tried them all
without result.</p>

<p class='c015'>Discouraged by so many failures, tired and
weak from want of food, the spirits of our
poor Prudence sank to zero.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What am I to do with her?” she asked,
as if calling creation to witness her perplexity
“Shall I find no one to take her?”</p>

<p class='c015'>While in this disturbed frame of mind she
walked meditatively onward, and stopped
before a little newspaper and tobacco shop,
reading the posters displayed outside, without
understanding a word. Suddenly, amidst the
tumult of her thoughts, she noticed that a
pleasant-looking woman was sitting behind
the counter reading and knitting. This
stranger might help her. She entered, and
having selected and paid for a <cite>Graphic</cite>, and
read some remarks on the weather, said as if
though an after-thought,</p>

<p class='c015'>“By the way, do you know of any respectable
woman that would take care of a
baby?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do you mean a nurse to live indoors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>ma’am, or a person to take care of the child
at her own home?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I mean someone who would take a baby
to live with her, and show it every kindness.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s not so easy to get, ma’am, and I
can’t say as I do know anyone I could
recommend.” Then, with a sharp glance,
“May I arsk if the child is your own?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh dear, no!” cried Miss Prudence
hastily. “It is my sister.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your sister’s—a— And is your sister
dead?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Dead! of course not. Why should I
want a home for her if she were?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Beg pardon, ma’am, I didn’t understand
you wanted a home for the lady too, I
thought as you said only for the baby.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It <em>is</em> only for the baby,” replied Prudence
in confusion. “The baby is my sister.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your sister?” repeated the woman, surprised.
“Your sister a baby?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes,” answered Prudence, rather nettled.
“My sister is a baby, there is nothing so
wonderful in that I hope.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The woman looked as if she would like to
ask some further questions, but checked herself
and said,</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, of course not. It’s none of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>business, anyhow—and by the way I’ve just
remembered something that might do if I
can find it. About six months ago one of
my customers arsked me to put up a bill in the
window, wishing for to adopt a child, an’ I
did, but nothink came of it, and so I took it
down after a month or two and put it aside
somewhere. If I could find it, it might be
somethink like you want.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Pray do look for it. I shall be greatly
obliged.”</p>

<p class='c015'>After some rummaging in various drawers
and boxes, and calling upstairs to an invisible
“’Lizer,” the document, dirty and fly-stained,
was found under a heap of old newspapers
and handed to Prudence.</p>

<p class='c015'>It read:—</p>

<p class='c017'>“A respectable married woman, having no children of
her own, would like to adopt or mind a healthy baby.
Comfortable home. Care and affection of a mother
guaranteed. Premium required. Address, by letter
only, X. Y. Z., 42, Plummer’s Cottages, Barker’s Rents,
Elm Lane.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Miss Prudence was enchanted.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The very thing!” she exclaimed.
“‘Comfortable home.’ ‘Care and affection
of a mother guaranteed.’ Just what I want.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>She copied the address, thanked the shop-woman
profusely, and gave her half-a-crown
for her trouble. Lunch hour at Beaconsfield
Gardens was long past, so Prudence ate a
bun, drank a glass of milk, and thought she
had done a good morning’s work.</p>

<p class='c015'>The chief drawback was that she should
now have to keep Augusta concealed for at
least another day, instead of being able to
smuggle her out of the house that night as
she had hoped. It was a risk, but she had
no alternative, much as she dreaded the
secret in some way getting out. She found
Augusta sleeping. A vague hope had sprung
up in her breast that on her return she might
discover her sister in her normal condition,
and be able to look back on the events of the
night as a bad dream. She was doomed to
disappointment. It was all but too real.
Without disturbing the infant, at whom she
gazed for a time with mingled pity and
aversion, she sat down and wrote at once to
X. Y. Z., asking that respectable married
woman if she were still willing to undertake
the care of a baby, and if she would write,
or wire by return, appointing a place of
meeting, as there was a little baby girl she
would like to entrust to her motherly care.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Though she was unwilling that the child
should be permanently adopted, she felt sure
that some mutually satisfactory arrangement
might be entered into. She wound up,
“Pray write or telegraph at once without fail,
as the case is urgent, and I will pay you handsomely
for your trouble.” This she signed
with initials, gave the address of a neighbouring
stationer’s, where letters were received at
a penny each, and posted it herself.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH MISS PRUDENCE EXPLAINS MATTERS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The next thing Miss Prudence felt she
should do was to see Mrs. Wilcox and
prepare her for hearing at any time that
Augusta had left suddenly. Mrs. Wilcox sat
in the little room she called her Office, where
she received callers on business, made up her
books, wrote letters, and otherwise employed
herself.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I am so sorry to hear your sister is not
well,” she said as Prudence entered. “I
hope she feels better now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not much, I am afraid,” said Prudence.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Will she be able to come down to
tea?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I—I fear not.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then she is worse than I thought. I
had better go and see her. Will you tell her
I will come up presently?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>“Oh, thanks, but I don’t think it would be
advisable to disturb her just now. She
prefers keeping quite quiet. You see this
is—is a very severe attack. I never saw her
quite like this before.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Good gracious! You don’t say she is as
ill as all that?” cried Mrs. Wilcox, whose
one weakness was a frantic fear of contagious
maladies. “You don’t think it can be any
thing serious coming on? They say there is
a lot of fever and diphtheria about. Excuse
my asking, Miss Prudence, but what are her
symptoms? We must take precautions in a
house like this.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Her symptoms? Oh, her symptoms—her
symptoms are rather peculiar.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Indeed. Head-ache? Sore throat? Pain
in the back?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, no. Nothing like that. I—am sure
it is nothing infectious.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I hope not, but please tell me what does
she complain of?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“A—a sort of shrinking feeling?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh! a sinking feeling. No doubt the
stomach is out of order. She has taken
something that disagreed with her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I feel sure she has.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But if there is nothing more serious than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>this feeling of sinking, she will probably be
able to come down to dinner. Meals in the
bedrooms you know are such a trouble to the
servants.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t think she can come down. She
is far too ill. She won’t take any dinner.
Just a glass of milk.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But, Miss Prudence, I fear she must
really have some other symptoms that you
are keeping back from me. Do pray tell
me frankly what else you see amiss with
her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well,” said the badgered Prudence, “I
have noticed a—a—a sort of childishness
about her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Good Heavens! You don’t say so! She
is not—not delirious? Not wandering in her
mind, is she?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, no. She is very silent—on the
contrary—has not spoken to me at all.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But you said she was childish.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I did not mean in that way—it is difficult
to explain.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It seems to be,” said Mrs. Wilcox drily,
“in your place I should have Doctor Creedy
in at once. You know, Miss Semaphore, we
must take precautions—we must take precautions—and
if your sister has any symptoms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>betokening infectious disease, I lay it on you
as a matter of conscience to tell me about it
at once, that her removal may be arranged
for before it is too late.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You are mistaken, indeed, you are
mistaken, Mrs. Wilcox,” urged poor Miss
Prudence, with tears in her eyes. “There is
no possible need for alarm. It really is
nothing catching. I only wish it were.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m sure I don’t,” interjected Mrs.
Wilcox, more than ever amazed by the
confusion of Prudence.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I don’t exactly mean that, but there
is no earthly cause for alarm on your part.
If Augusta had anything serious the matter
with her, anything in that way, I’d be the
very first to tell you, and to send for the
doctor, but she hasn’t. She just is—is—not
quite herself—has very little appetite and so
on—I—I saw a great change in her appearance
this morning, and it alarmed me. I
think, and she agrees with me—indeed this
is what I came to say, that if she went away
to-morrow or next day for change of air, and
meantime kept very quiet, was not disturbed
in any way or by anyone, she would soon be
all right.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You know best!” said Mrs. Wilcox, “but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>don’t you really think it would be well for
me to go up and see her presently? I would
not disturb her in the least.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Thanks, no. I should say it would be
better not. She does not like being roused
in any way. She is so silent; in fact,” with
a flash of inspiration, “she has completely
lost her voice. Then the shrinking—I mean,
of course, as you say, the sinking—is so
painful.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, very well,” said Mrs. Wilcox offended,
“I do not want to press the matter. But I
think she had better have something to eat.
What shall it be? A glass of milk is
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She cares for nothing else.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But don’t you think she ought to have
some beef-tea and a little dry toast? That
cannot possibly harm her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Very well. Anything you like,” said
Prudence desperately, for she felt she could
stand no more questioning, and gladly made
her escape to her own room under cover of
Mrs. Wilcox’s directions to the cook on
behalf of the supposed invalid.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mary, the housemaid, presently brought
up a tray and tried the handle of Augusta’s
door, only to find it locked. Prudence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>peeped out of her apartment and bade the
girl lay the tray on the mat, promising to
take it in presently. At this, Mary, who did
not like the Misses Semaphore, flounced
angrily downstairs, muttering, “Some people
is so mystearyous.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <span class='large'>THE MEDICAL LADY INTERVENES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Miss Prudence did not appear at afternoon
tea, so the symptoms of her sister, her
refusal, or, at least, disinclination to call in
a doctor, her extraordinary confusion and
contradictory statements, as detailed by Mrs.
Wilcox, were canvassed with much freedom
by the boarders present. Mrs. Wilcox
discreetly abstained from mentioning her
suspicions, or using the ugly word “infection,”
but she privately requested the medical lady
to visit the invalid, and make a truthful report
as to her condition.</p>

<p class='c015'>The medical lady was a woman who had
no weakness about her. She always recommended
drastic remedies, and applied them if
possible. She professed to enjoy her cold
tub in the iciest weather. Nothing would
persuade her that anyone who paled or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>fainted at the sight of blood or of ghastly
accidents, or corpses, or took no delight in
anatomical specimens in bottles, was not an
affected creature. Mice she herself disliked,
but that, she argued, was different. She
administered physic with pleasure, and the
nastier it was, and the more the ridiculous
patient disliked it, the more she insisted on
giving it as prescribed. She liked to take
command of a sick-room as an admiral of his
quarter deck, putting the invalid’s relatives to
one side and making them feel they were
intruders. As she assured them that responsibility
for the death of the person afflicted
would lie at their door if they resisted, they
were generally afraid to turn her out, while
the invalid was unable. She inspired Miss
Prudence with terror, which expressed itself
in slavish deference and humility, for, conscious
of her own weakness, she felt, and
with justice, that the medical lady despised
her.</p>

<p class='c015'>The younger Miss Semaphore was sitting
solitary in her own room by the window,
absorbed in anxious thought. The door of
communication with her sister’s apartment
stood open, so that she commanded a view of
the bed and of the infant Augusta. Suddenly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>she started to her feet. Someone had
knocked sharply at Augusta’s door, and
immediately turned the handle. Finding it
resisted efforts to open it, the voice of the
medical lady was heard in the corridor, saying
sweetly, “My dear Miss Semaphore, will you
not let me in? I have come to enquire how
you are.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Augusta heard, and, forgetful of her voiceless
condition, evidently made a desperate
effort to summon Prudence, for she gave a
feeble whimper.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Hush! Do be quiet,” cried Prudence in
a frightened, undertone. Then opening her
own door, she looked out into the corridor.
The medical lady was discovered kneeling on
the mat and trying to peep through the
keyhole. She started into an erect position
with marvellous celerity.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do you want anything, Miss Lord,”
asked Prudence timidly, yet with something
of resentment in her tone.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh! your dear sister,” said Miss Lord,
slightly embarrassed, I just wanted to
see her, but somehow I cannot open the
door. I thought that possibly she might be
glad of my services.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“The door is locked,” answered Prudence.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>“My sister is not very well, and does not
wish to be disturbed. She is trying to
sleep.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But she will see me, my dear Miss
Semaphore. I may be able to advise some
course of treatment that will do her
good.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Thank you, Miss Lord she is asleep just
now, and I do not think would care to see
anyone.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, but I’ll not disturb her. I’ll just
have a look at her in order to reassure you.
You must be uneasy about her. I hear she
is very ill.”</p>

<p class='c015'>As she spoke the medical lady edged up to
Prudence.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Thank you; you are extremely kind, but
I am really not so anxious. She is not so
very ill, she is somewhat better now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But I hear that you told Mrs. Wilcox
after lunch that she was very ill indeed.
This is a sudden change.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No—yes—not <em>very</em> ill. She’ll be better
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But I think, my dear Miss Semaphore,
you really ought to let me see her. As you
decline to send for a doctor, someone with
the requisite medical knowledge should be in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>attendance; and, forgive me for saying so, I
do not think you are a very competent nurse.
Besides, we owe it to Mrs. Wilcox to make
sure your sister is not threatened with
anything contagious.”</p>

<p class='c015'>All this time the resolute medical lady had,
step by step, moved Prudence back, so that
they both stood within her room. Her eye
caught the open door.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do let me in,” said the medical lady.
“I advise it in your own interests. Let me
have a peep at her, and if, as you say, she is
better and sleeping, I shall be able to reassure
Mrs. Wilcox and the others. Miss Belcher
and Mrs. Dumaresq are so terribly afraid of
anything infectious, that at tea they were
talking of leaving.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No,” said Prudence, driven into a corner,
“you shall not see her, Miss Lord. She is
getting on all right, and does not want to see
anyone.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Shan’t I?” suddenly ejaculated the medical
lady; and before Prudence knew what
she intended, she made a dash at the open
door leading to Augusta’s room. Prudence,
however, was too quick for her. She
reached it first, pulled it to, locked it, for the
key fortunately was on her side, and, putting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>her back to it, stood flushed, panting, and
breathless, facing Miss Lord.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How dare you!” she cried, stung out of
her ordinary meekness. “This is outrageous.
Leave my room at once; no one asked you
to come here.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Miss Lord was hateful to look upon at that
moment. If a soft featherbed had risen up
and struck her in the face, she could scarcely
have been more surprised.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Ha, ha!” she said menacingly, “so there
is a mystery here!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Will you go, please?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh yes, I’ll go.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She stopped at the outer door.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You had better take care, Miss Prudence
Semaphore,” with a withering emphasis on
the “Prudence.” “Perhaps I know more
than you think. You may be sorry for this
yet.”</p>

<p class='c015'>With these vague but direful words she
disappeared, leaving Prudence collapsed, her
knees trembling under her, her mind filled
with the gloomiest forebodings, and an undefined
terror in her breast as to what Miss
Lord might know.</p>

<p class='c015'>How she got through the rest of that
dreadful day Prudence never remembered.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>She dreaded the ordeal of dinner; but
though the medical lady had evidently told
her story, and there was an atmosphere of
disquiet, no direct questions were asked, so
the meal passed off better than she had
expected. Still, the marked avoidance of the
subject of her sister’s illness was a new source
of uneasiness.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m sure they think she has cholera or
leprosy, or that I am poisoning her,” mused
Prudence dolefully, as she crumbled her
bread, and a dull resentment against Augusta,
who had involved her in all this trouble and
deceit, smouldered in her breast.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was an added loftiness in. Mrs.
Dumaresq’s manner which showed that Miss
Semaphore had somehow incurred her displeasure,
while Mrs. Whitley omitted to
pass her the salt and pepper, which, with
fussy officiousness, she presented to everyone
else.</p>

<p class='c015'>Good-natured Miss Belcher alone, forgetting
Toutou and Miss Augusta’s bad
temper, came up to her as the ladies filed out
of the dining-room and said,</p>

<p class='c015'>“I hope your sister is better.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, thank you,” replied Prudence
faintly.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“How tired and pale you look. I do
believe you are fagged out nursing her.
Do let me help, if I can be of any use to
you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You cannot help me, thank you,” said
Prudence, with a sudden impulse to kiss her.
“She does not like anyone else to come near
her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Cross, tyrannical old thing,” thought little
Miss Belcher, who pitied Prudence for the
slavery to which she submitted from her
sister.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, cheer up, dear Miss Prudence,”
she said sympathetically. “I am glad she
is better. Perhaps she may be all right
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m sure I hope so,” answered the
depressed Prudence, as she made her way to
her own apartment. To-night she had no
heart to enter the drawing-room and angle
for a few words of conversation from Major
Jones, round-eyed, stupid Mr. Batley, or
gruff Mr. Lorimer, or to join the game of
whist that so often resulted in personalities.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was still a painful scene before her.
She must tell her sister that Mrs. Geldheraus
had left England, and that there was consequently
no immediate hope of her resuming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>her proper size. Ever since Augusta awoke
and saw that her sister had returned, she had
followed her movements with anxious and
enquiring eyes; but Prudence determined to
give her no information until night, when all
the boarders were safely in bed, and when
infantile cries were unlikely to reach them.
Accordingly, having waited until one by one
the residents at 37, Beaconsfield Gardens,
had departed to their several rooms, and the
house was wrapped in repose, Prudence
stole into her sister’s apartment and communicated
the disastrous intelligence. She had
reason to congratulate herself on the choice
of so late an hour, for Augusta, despite
prayers and remonstrances, took it very
badly indeed. She sobbed, howled, kicked,
balled her little red fists into her eyes, and in
every way that her circumstances permitted
expressed her sorrow, anger, and disappointment.
In vain Prudence implored her to be
quiet. Her overwhelming dismay apparently
shut out all other thought, and it was only
when her sister actually put a pillow over her
head, to stifle her cries, that she consented to
moderate the expression of her grief. Once
she grew quieter, the tender-hearted Prudence
took her up, kissed and tried to comfort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>her, walking her up and down the room as
if she were in reality the baby she seemed
to be, and continued this soothing progress
until Augusta wept herself to sleep in her
arms.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <span class='large'>“GOOD MRS. BROWN.”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Early next morning Prudence carefully
locked all the doors of her own room and of
her sister’s apartment and went round to the
stationer’s to see if a letter had come for her
from X. Y. Z. With much relief she picked
out, from a bundle of others, a missive
addressed to P. S., and proceeded to read it.
It was tolerably written and spelled, the
paper was clean, and the communication
was signed “Mrs. Brown.” “Mrs. Brown”
agreed to meet Prudence at nine o’clock that
evening in the first-class waiting room at
London Bridge Station, and had no doubt
they would come to terms. “She was prepared,”
she said, “to take the pretty little
dear and treat it with a mother’s love,” and
regretted that she was unable to make an
appointment earlier in the day “on account
of family reasons.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Perilous as was the delay to Prudence, she
was pleased with the letter. The writer, if
not a person of culture, was evidently kind
and respectable, so she resolved to be
patient, and bear the strain of the situation
for a few hours longer.</p>

<p class='c015'>Her next move was to purchase a feeding
bottle, for her previous efforts to make
Augusta swallow milk had been singularly
unsuccessful, and she was filled with uneasiness
lest her sister might be starved to death.
She then returned home, fed Augusta,
washed her, and dressed her in the garments
provided by Whiteley, and finally proceeded
to explain to her the measures she had taken.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I have told you already,” she said, “that
if you remained like this it would be impossible
to keep you here. They all look suspiciously
at me downstairs, and I really
believe they think you have either got the
plague, or else that I am slowly poisoning
you. Mrs. Wilcox spoke to me again
about getting a doctor, and I am afraid
that at any moment she may come with
one, and insist on his seeing you. Now,
I have our good name to consider, and
I know that if you are not sent away, and
sent speedily, Miss Lord will be capable of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>breaking in the door. Then, if you are
discovered, we shall simply be lost. As for
telling the truth, they wouldn’t believe me if
I swore to it. It is no use your objecting,
Augusta, if you mean that squirm for an
objection. You have got yourself and me
into this hole, and the least you can do is to
be quiet and help me to avoid scandal.
There you go again. What on earth do you
mean? If you want me to keep you here
until Mrs. Geldheraus replies, it simply can’t
be done. She may not write for a week,
and every moment I am running risk of
discovery. No, I shall convey you away
to-night, whatever happens. Every question
asked about you sends my heart into my
mouth. I have been making arrangements
for your comfort. You are to go to a nice,
respectable, married woman, who has no
children of her own. She guarantees you a
good home, with the care and affection of a
mother. I have thought out everything.
When you are gone, I shall send some of our
boxes to Paddington Station as a blind. I
had better stay on here for a week or a
fortnight after you, just to disarm suspicion.
By that time we shall know what Mrs.
Geldheraus can do for you, and we must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>shape our future actions accordingly. Gracious
Heaven! if she says she can do
nothing for you, what will become of us? I
suppose I shall have to pretend you are dead,
and rear you somewhere as my adopted
daughter! It is a horrible position to be
placed in. I am getting hardened to telling
falsehoods to those people downstairs, and
yet I tremble at the life of deceit I see before
me. We shall have to avoid all our friends—everyone
who has known us. If I were
even sure you would gradually grow up as an
ordinary baby does, I might look forward to
your speaking in a year or so, and then you
might advise me what to do, but if you remain
always dumb, and always a baby——!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Overcome by her troubles, and by the long
vista of difficulties she saw opening before
her, poor Prudence sobbed aloud.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was much to be done, however, so
she bathed her eyes, powdered her flushed
cheeks, and proceeded to pack up such
indispensable articles as would be needed by
Augusta. She kept to her room as much as
possible all day. At dinner she announced
that her sister was better, and that she herself
might possibly spend the evening with
some friends, so requested that the front door
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>might be left unchained, to permit of her
letting herself in with a latch-key that she
borrowed from Major Jones. Nobody made
any comment. The general opinion as to
her treatment of her poor suffering sister, was
too strong to admit of anything short of the
whole truth being spoken.</p>

<p class='c015'>Prudence, congratulating herself therefore
on having acted so well, slipped upstairs and
arrayed herself in a black hat, a thick veil,
and a long cloak. Augusta she tucked up
warmly in an old shawl, gave her her feeding
bottle, and, having hidden her under the
voluminous folds of the mantle, peeped
cautiously out to make sure the coast was
clear. Not a soul was in sight, so Prudence,
with as guilty an air as if she were carrying
off Mrs. Wilcox’s silver, crept downstairs,
opened the front door, and closed it softly
behind her.</p>

<p class='c015'>She scarcely breathed until she was clear
of Beaconsfield Gardens, and so closely did
she keep Augusta pressed to her bosom, that
when she perceived what she was doing a
spasm of terror shot through her.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How quiet she is,” she thought. “Perhaps
I have smothered her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>A glance reassured her, and she sped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>onwards. Suddenly her knees seemed to
give way. Advancing towards her, but as
yet unconscious of her presence, was old
Major Jones, who had just stepped out of a
tobacconist’s shop, and was smoking a postprandial
cigar. Prudence darted across the
road, turned down a side street, and terrified
of meeting someone else who knew her, ran
all the way to South Kensington Station.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was no one in the first-class ladies’
waiting-room at London Bridge Station
when Prudence arrived with her charge,
except an elderly person on guard in a
battered black bonnet and a woollen crochet
shoulder shawl. It wanted twenty minutes
of the time fixed by Mrs. Brown for the
meeting, so Prudence, feeling really weak and
ill from excitement and lack of food, that
for two days she had been unable to taste,
gave the female sixpence to hold Augusta,
while she partook of a cup of tea in the
refreshment room.</p>

<p class='c015'>As she returned, piercing yells were audible
long before she reached the waiting-room,
and hastily entering she found her sister
purple in the face, and bent backwards like a
bow in the arms of the attendant.</p>

<p class='c015'>Her nurse was jogging her roughly up and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>down, regarding her the while with an eye of
dissatisfaction, not to say of dislike.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m glad you’ve come back, ma’am,” she
said, rising hastily as Prudence entered, and
holding out her charge at arm’s length.
“This baby o’ yours is the very crossest
child I ever did see. I thought at first there
was a pin in her clothes may be—it’s a little
girl, ain’t it?—but I looked, and there’s never
a one to be found, so it’s temper, so it is—and
if I was you, ma’am, meaning no offence,
I’d spank her well, young as she is, to take
the mischief out of her. You can’t begin too
soon with that sort. Just look what she’s
done to my face!”</p>

<p class='c015'>There certainly was a scratch on the old
woman’s nose.</p>

<p class='c015'>Prudence took her sister in silence, and
tried to soothe her. Augusta, she knew,
was fastidious, and probably disliked being
held by the snuffy old caretaker, yet she
could not help considering that under the
circumstances the infliction might have been
borne. Still, the baby continued to yell so
that the people looked in to see what was the
matter. She made prolonged efforts to
disengage one leg from her lengthy and
cumbersome draperies, till attracted by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>frequency of the movement, Prudence examined
her more closely. As she turned up
the robe, Augusta stopped crying. There on
her red-mottled limb was a nasty blue mark,
where the irritated caretaker had given her a
pinch.</p>

<p class='c015'>Under other circumstances the tender-hearted
Prudence would have remonstrated
with the woman on her cruelty to a helpless
infant. As it was, she did not dare risk a
scene, so took an opportunity to whisper
sympathy to Augusta, and implore her to be
patient.</p>

<p class='c015'>After many anxious glances at the clock,
the hands marked the hour named by Mrs.
Brown, and, at the moment, a bustling, fresh-complexioned
woman of about five-and-fifty,
stout and respectably dressed, hurried into
the room, and, first casting a comprehensive
glance around, walked over to Prudence, and
said,</p>

<p class='c015'>“Excuse me, ma’am, but are you here
with reference to a child?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Are you Mrs. Brown?” asked Prudence,
favourably impressed by her appearance of
cleanliness and her businesslike manner.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, ma’am, I ham Mrs. Brown, otherwise
X. Y. Z.—‘good Mrs. Brown,’ they calls me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>down our wy; and you, ma’am, I suppose
are P. S.?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes,” said Prudence faintly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“And this is the dear baby? Pitty ickle
sing!” said Mrs. Brown, making a dab with
a motherly forefinger at Augusta’s cheek.
Augusta looked at her very hard, and
Prudence could not help hoping that she was
as favourably impressed as herself.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes,” she said, “this is the baby I wish
you to take charge of, and on whom I hope
you will bestow motherly care.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That, ma’am,” replied Mrs. Brown, “you
may rest assured on. How old is the little
dear?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Prudence was all confusion.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I really don’t know,” she faltered. “A
few years—I mean a few months old—about
six weeks, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is the baby your own, ma’am?” enquired
Mrs. Brown in a tone of surprise.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, dear, no!” cried Prudence aghast.
“It is not my child at all. As a matter of
fact, I am not married.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Indeed! You’ll excuse me asking the
question, ma’am; but in a matter of business
like this you understand one has to be particular,
with such a fine, comfortable, ’appy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>’ome as I’ve to offer too; and might I
enquire exactly what relation the pretty dear
is to you? All communications, ma’am, are
treated in strict confidence.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She is my sister.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your sister!” gasped Mrs. Brown, looking
Prudence up and down. “Oh! your
<em>sister’s</em>. And now, ma’am, excuse my
asking, but is your sister a married lady?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course not,” said Prudence, adding
with a sickly smile, “I think you might be
pretty sure of that?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“<em>Of course not!</em>” repeated Mrs. Brown
under her breath in a tone of deep astonishment.
“<em>Of course</em> not!” adding to herself,
happily unheard by Prudence, “well, of all
the braigen! and she lookin’ so quiet too.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, ma’am,” she continued aloud,
“under them circumstances of course you
understand my terms is according.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“According to what?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“To them circumstances, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“They are unusual,” admitted Prudence,
“and I am quite prepared to remunerate you
amply for any trouble you take with this dear
child.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That child, ma’am, though I say it, is a
fortunate child in comin’ to one as’ll give her—it’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>a little girl, isn’t it?—as’ll give her a
mother’s care and love; and take her I can’t,
ma’am, for less than a premium of fifty
pounds down an’ a weekly payment of one
pound.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It seems a good deal for a baby.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, ma’am, it’s not a good deal, it’s
cheap, too cheap maybe, but I’ve my nater’l
feelings, an’ I’ve took to the child, so I’m
makin’ terms for you an’ your sister as I
wouldn’t for another lydy in a similar case.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, unfortunately,” said Prudence
timidly, “I did not expect to have to pay so
much, and only brought a smaller sum with
me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How much?” asked good Mrs. Brown
briefly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Twenty pounds,” said Prudence. “You
see I never had to—was concerned in—I
mean I never before had anything to do with
babies, at least in this way, and I thought—that
is to say, twenty pounds seemed a good
deal, especially as I am to make you regular
weekly payments as well.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Twenty pounds!” shrieked Mrs. Brown.
“Is it twenty pounds for a mother’s care and
love and dooty, and a comfortable ’ome an’
no unpleasant questions asked?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>“Of course not, of course not,” said
Prudence hastily. “I see now it was too
little, but how am I to manage about the
matter, as I have not got fifty pounds
here?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Brown looked at her keenly. “I’ll
trust you, ma’am,” she said, “for I’m that
soft-’earted, an’ I’ve took to the child. Pay
me the twenty down, an’ send me thirty in
Bank of England notes—none o’ yer
cheques—within twenty-four hours, and I’ll
take the little darling away.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Very well,” said Prudence relieved. “I
will do as you say; but oh! Mrs. Brown, be
sure you take every care of her, let her want
for nothing;” and two big tears stood in the
good-natured creature’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Madam,” answered Mrs. Brown, “it’s a
lucky child as comes to me; and now will
you please give me your name and address,
and just write a promise to pay on this ’ere
bit of paper, and hand me over the twenty
pounds and I’ll give you a receipt; and
give me the byby, for my train is about due,
and you’ve got my name and address, and I
expects to be notified whenever you’re a
coming to see the byby, and I never allows
as payments to be more than a week in
arrears, or I brings back the child.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Prudence was rather bewildered by Mrs.
Brown’s last lengthy and rapid speech, “I
never allows no payments to be more than a
week in arrears.”</p>

<p class='c015'>What could she mean by that? It really
sounded as if she were familiar with transactions
of the kind, but surely no respectable
married woman, so nice in appearance too,
even though her grammar was not faultless,
would need more than one child to adopt; so,
telling herself she had misunderstood, Prudence
paid down the twenty pounds, kissed
Augusta, saw Mrs. Brown and that infant
into the train, and then relieved, yet with
many cares on her mind, made her way back
to Beaconsfield Gardens.</p>

<p class='c015'>Meantime Mrs. Brown, who watched her
standing on the platform until the train
moved out of the station, began to feel she
had made a bad bargain.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I was a bloomin’ idiot not to arsk
thirty bob,” she muttered, “an’ a ’undred
down. She’s that soft she’d ’ave given it.
There! stow it, you brat!” she added with
sudden fury, turning to Augusta, who had
set up a dismal wail.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE MEDICAL LADY BAFFLED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>No. 37, Beaconsfield Gardens, South Kensington,
was in a ferment of excitement.
Something had happened. The boarders
did not quite know what, but there was in
the air that electrical unrest that spreads so
rapidly from one individual to another.</p>

<p class='c015'>The mystery of Miss Semaphore’s illness
was under discussion. What ailed her?
She had eaten nothing for two days. Was
she really better? Was she worse? Why
this secrecy and embarrassment on the part
of the usually garrulous and impulsive Prudence?
Why was no doctor called in?
Why, why, why, in a thousand forms, was
the favourite interrogative pronoun on the
lips of the ladies and gentlemen as they sat
round the fire after dinner and discussed
something more interesting to them than the
<cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>, that oracle beloved of
boarding-houses.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>When tea was served, the maid sent up by
Mrs. Wilcox to remind Prudence that it was
waiting in the drawing-room, knocked long
and vainly at her door, and at last, turning
the handle, discovered that the apartment
was empty. Knocking at Augusta’s door
likewise had no result, and the girl came
down to say she thought Miss Prudence
Semaphore must have gone out already.</p>

<p class='c015'>This was confirmed by Major Jones,
who remembered seeing someone like her
turn down Tate Street when on his way
home.</p>

<p class='c015'>Where had she gone to? All the ladies
at her table were anxious to know, but they
asked in vain. The medical woman saw that
her opportunity had come.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I shall take advantage of her absence,”
she said resolutely, “to visit that poor, suffering
sister of hers, whom I consider she has
treated shamefully.”</p>

<p class='c015'>There was a murmur of applause at this
noble resolution, and the medical woman,
having hastily swallowed her tea, rose from
table and made her way upstairs. Mrs.
Whitley followed at a convenient distance.
She was curious, but not daring. The medical
woman knocked at the door of Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Augusta’s room, and listened for a reply.
There was none. She repeated the knock,
and then tried the handle; the door was
locked from the inside, and the key, sticking
in it, prevented anything like a satisfactory
view of the interior.</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear Miss Semaphore, it is only me,”
she murmured ungrammatically; “I have
come to enquire for you. May I not come
in?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Miss Semaphore naturally did not
answer. The medical woman stood straight
up and reflected for half-a-second.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It is my duty,” she said aloud, and, thus
braced to the task, marched to the door of
Prudence’s room, opened it, passed in, and
entered the sleeping apartment of the elder
Miss Semaphore. Mrs. Whitley by this time
had come forward, and paused as she passed
the threshold. The medical woman was just
emerging with a bewildered face, when she
saw her, and exclaimed,</p>

<p class='c015'>“She has gone!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gone!” ejaculated Mrs. Whitley.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, gone! There is no one there!
The room is empty!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What an ex-tra-or-dinary thing! Why
where on earth can she have gone to, and at
this time of night too?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>“There is some mystery here,” said the
medical woman solemnly. “All is not right,
but I’ll see this matter out, or my name is
not Jane Lord.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Downstairs went Mrs. Whitley and “Jane
Lord” to tell the news. There was an
excited chorus of enquiries to a duet of
replies.</p>

<p class='c015'>Why and how had Prudence Semaphore
spirited away her sick sister? What had
happened? She had certainly told Mrs.
Wilcox that Miss Augusta would go for
change of air, but who could imagine her
sneaking off in the evening without luggage
or farewell? There was something behind
it, but what?</p>

<p class='c015'>“It sounds just like one of those horrid
police cases one reads in the papers,” said
Mrs. Dumaresq; “I do hope the poor creature
has not been murdered and the body
conveyed away.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Good gracious!” exclaimed Mrs. Whitley,
“surely you don’t think her sister—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t think anything,” said Mrs. Dumaresq
with dignity; “but I must say Miss
Prudence Semaphore’s manner has more than
once struck me as peculiar.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Whitley lowered her voice to an awe-stricken
whisper.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>“Then you think, perhaps, she has gone
mad and murdered her sister? How awful!
The police should be told at once, they
really should.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear Mrs. Whitley, do not be so
hasty. Whatever my suspicions may be, I
have not formulated them. In diplomacy
one learns never to jump to conclusions; but
I confess this seems to me to be a very
mysterious and unpleasant affair. It makes
me regret ever having come to a boarding-house,
in spite of the advice of my dearest
friend, the Duchess of Middlesex. ‘Don’t go
to any such place, Mimi,’ she said. She
always calls me ‘Mimi.’ ‘You never can tell
who you may meet or what may happen,
and it is so very unpleasant to be mixed up
with persons with whom one cannot associate.’
Didn’t she, Angelo?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Mr. Dumaresq, as usual, confirmed his
wife’s statement.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But do you really think there is something
wrong—that a crime has been committed?”
asked the little group of ladies one
of the other.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I, for one, should not be surprised,” said
the medical woman boldly; “but it is well
not to speak till one is certain, and of course
I may be mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“But did you—did you notice anything
wrong in the room just now, any signs of a
struggle, or—or poison of any kind, or a
weapon?” asked Mrs. Whitley. “I suppose
you looked?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Frankly,” said the medical woman, “I
did not; I was so surprised and taken aback
when I found she was not there, that I just
looked at nothing at all except the bed.
That had been slept in apparently, and I
think the room was rather untidy, but I did
not stay a moment.’</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t you think, ladies,” said Mrs.
Whitley, in a low voice, “that it would be
well for Miss Lord and myself to run
upstairs now and thoroughly investigate the
apartment?”</p>

<p class='c015'>The others agreed; so the medical lady
and her satellite made their way to Miss
Semaphore’s room, and conscientiously poked
into every corner. They found nothing except
a twist of Miss Augusta’s false hair, and
a baby’s knitted boot. This last the medical
woman picked up and held out.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where did this come from, I wonder,”
said she; “I suppose one of them made it
for some charity.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No doubt,” said Mrs. Whitley; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>having fruitlessly investigated everything that
had been left unlocked, and shaken every
door, box, or wardrobe that was securely
fastened, they turned to make their way to
the morning room, a little disappointed at
their fruitless search.</p>

<p class='c015'>Unfortunately, just as they were passing
through, Prudence returned home, and meeting
them on the threshold, at once divined
that they had been investigating in her
absence. They noted her frightened face,
and the look of relief that crossed it at the
recollection that after all there was nothing
to find. The medical lady thought it best to
carry off their proceedings with a high hand.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Dear, dear!” she said, laughing; “don’t
look so startled, Miss Semaphore. We
thought that as we saw or heard nothing
of you at tea, we had better see you or
your sister, and enquire if we could be of use
to her in your absence; but you were both
out.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes,” said Prudence, breathlessly, “we
were both out; and I must say, Miss Lord,
I consider it a great liberty for you and Mrs.
Whitley to have entered my room and my
sister’s under the circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Highty toity,” responded the medical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>woman, “we were trying to do our duty by
your unfortunate sister, whom you left without
proper medical attendance during her
illness, and have apparently taken out of her
sick bed this night at the risk of her life, and
conveyed away without the smallest necessary
precaution.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Terrible is the wrath of the sheep. Prudence
stood at bay in a towering rage.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Allow me to tell you, madam,” she said,
“that you know nothing at all about it. My
sister is perfectly well, never better in her
life, and I won’t be dictated to by you, or
Mrs. Whitley either, as to any course of
action I think fit to take.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I’m sure,” gasped the medical
woman, “this is what one gets for trying to
be kind to some people. Come away, my
dear Mrs. Whitley, and leave this—person.
Far from thanking us for our thoughtfulness
to her sister and herself, she only insults us.
Of course if poor Miss Augusta dies from
want of proper care, we shall not be to
blame,” and, with much dignity, the two
ladies swept downstairs, to tell the result of
their mission.</p>

<p class='c015'>That something was horribly wrong, all
the boarders were agreed, but as to what that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>something was, they differed. Was Miss
Augusta Semaphore living or dead? If living,
what was the nature of the mysterious
disease with which she was afflicted that
necessitated such prompt and secret action
on the part of her easy-going sister?</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Whitley, as one who had visited her
room, was terrified at this view of the case,
and went into strong hysterics at the idea of
having perhaps contracted some terrible
malady during her investigations. She was
not to be calmed until both she and the medical
woman, by the advice of the latter, went
through a course of thorough fumigation and
disinfection.</p>

<p class='c015'>Where was Augusta now? That was
another interesting theme for speculation.
Somewhere near, apparently, since Major
Jones had seen Prudence by herself in Tate
Street shortly after dinner. Nothing else
was talked of all day, but as Prudence came
down calmly to meals, seemingly happier and
more composed than she had been for some
days, excitement began to die down. Perhaps
there was nothing in it after all. Augusta
was queer; she might have insisted in going
off in the night like that. Anyhow, nothing
much could be wrong, or Prudence would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>never look so cheerful. As for her having
gone mad, or murdered her sister, even Mrs.
Whitley now laughed at the idea; but the
medical woman still clung to her belief that
all was not right.</p>

<p class='c015'>Poor, tired Prudence, weary of scheming,
and lying, and being badgered, felt the
change and rejoiced. If they only would
question her no more, how happy she might
be! A fortnight would soon pass, and by
that time, all suspicion being averted, she
might safely give notice and join her sister.
Meantime, to leave no room for speculation
as to her movements, she went out very
little, appeared at every meal, and told old
Mrs. Belcher, the most sympathetic of the
boarders, who immediately spread the story,
that her sister had gone to the seaside for a
change, and that if she did not speedily improve
in health, she, Prudence, would soon
join her there.</p>

<p class='c015'>All suspicions were now apparently tranquillized,
and Prudence, having despatched
by the first post a cheque for £30 to good
Mrs. Brown, felt sufficiently calm to await
events.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <span class='large'>AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The two following days passed peacefully
over. Prudence told her carefully-concocted
story to Mrs. Wilcox, and said she would
probably follow her sister in a fortnight.
She despatched a great box, avowedly for
the use of Augusta, to Paddington Station,
and left it at the cloak-room to be kept till
called for. She took every precaution that
suggested itself to her, and even contemplated
announcing at table the receipt of
a letter from her sister declaring she was
enjoying the fine sea air.</p>

<p class='c015'>In fact, she felt she was beginning to lie
with an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aplomb</span></i> that at once frightened and
delighted her, but was accompanied by
twinges of conscience. Many tears she shed
in secret over the deception she was forced
to practise.</p>

<p class='c015'>The interest and excitement about Miss
Semaphore had already abated somewhat.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Her room had been turned out, cleaned, and
made ready for a new boarder, and Prudence,
who had sent on the additional thirty pounds
to good Mrs. Brown, was congratulating herself
on having acted with great promptitude,
foresight, and caution, under trying and exceptional
circumstances.</p>

<p class='c015'>Her main idea now was to hear from the
widow of the explorer whose fatal Water of
Youth had proved the direful spring of all
her woes. Night and day she considered
the subject. Was there an antidote? If
not, would her sister ever grow up? If she
did grow up, would she grow up normally?
Had she really, as Prudence thought, preserved
her memory and understanding?
Was she to be treated exactly like an ordinary
baby? and, if not, in what respects
should a difference be made? Should she
be sent to school later on? Would her intelligence
grow or lessen? All these racking
questions, to which she could give no answer,
tormented the younger Miss Semaphore continually.</p>

<p class='c015'>When, sooner than she had ventured to
hope, she found a letter lying on the hall-table
addressed to her, in a foreign handwriting,
and bearing the Paris post-mark, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>poor lady was so overcome between fear and
hope that she scarcely had courage to open
it. With tottering limbs, she made her way
upstairs, locked her door, and sat down to
read the most important missive she had ever
received.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Geldheraus expressed herself shocked
and surprised at the sad story unfolded by
Miss Prudence Semaphore, but, unfortunately,
was not very helpful. She had never before
heard of anyone taking too much of the
Water of Youth, and knew of no method of
counteracting its effects.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I explained to your sister,” she said,
“that a tablespoonful took about ten years
off one’s age. Thus a woman of forty, taking
two tablespoonfuls, would, in effect, be
twenty. After that, a tea-spoonful every
two years, would keep her at twenty as long
as the Water lasted. She seemed quite to
understand my directions. As such a case
as you describe has never entered into my
experience, I fear, dear madam, I can only
recommend you to be patient under these
distressing circumstances. I can give you no
idea of how long the effects will last. Usually,
the greater the quantity required in the first
instance, the sooner the dose must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>repeated, as the acquired youth wears off with
a rapidity in proportion to one’s actual age.
Whether this, however, will be the case with
your sister, I cannot say. No one who has
hitherto tried the Water has returned to
infancy, so your sister’s is a very exceptional
and awkward position, especially, as you tell
me, you are living at a boarding-house. You
may be thankful that your sister did not take
a little more, or she would probably have
vanished for ever, and your circumstances
would be even more painful than they are.
It is most probable that she retains her adult
memory and understanding unimpaired, remaining
a woman in mind though not in
body. I regret, dear madam, that I cannot
be more helpful, and am, yours faithfully,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Sophie Geldheraus</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>As she concluded, Prudence broke down
utterly, and, throwing herself on her bed,
gave way to a bitter outburst of weeping.
There was nothing for it now but to let
things take their course, to accept all the
annoyance, deception, seclusion, and suspicion
involved in so anomalous, so unprecedented
a situation. She saw nothing before her
but a life spent in avoiding acquaintances,
in evading enquiry—the life of a fugitive,
dogged by a blameless past.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>“It is horrible, horrible!” she wailed. “If
it were anything else, I think I could bear it,
but this is so incredible, so unheard of. How
am I to manage about our business matters?
Will Mr. Carson believe me if I tell him the
truth? Will he ever credit that the infant I
show him is Augusta?” (Mr. Carson was
the solicitor who managed the affairs of the
Misses Semaphore.) “What about signing
deeds and so forth? Then, if I pretend she
has died, he will want to come to the funeral,
or see the death certificate, or take out probate,
or something of that kind that will
involve enquiry. Oh! what, what am I to
do?”</p>

<p class='c015'>At last, exhausted by weeping, Miss Prudence
lay still, and stared with sodden eyes
at the flies dancing on the ceiling. The one
agreeable object of her reflections was that at
least she had got Augusta safely away, and
placed her in hands that were both kind and
safe.</p>

<p class='c015'>A longing to see her sister came over her.
Though Augusta was dumb and helpless, it
would at least be some consolation to talk to
her, to pour out her woes.</p>

<p class='c015'>To a woman of the stamp of Prudence, the
necessity for secretiveness, for independent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>or uncounselled action, is terrible. She
wanted someone to advise her, someone to
lean on, and little consolation as she could
expect from communing with Augusta, it
would at least be a relief to say all that was
in her mind.</p>

<p class='c015'>Accordingly she rose, wrote a few lines to
“good Mrs. Brown,” announcing her intention
of calling at Plummer’s Cottages the following
afternoon, and having donned a thick
veil to conceal her distorted features, proceeded
to post the note.</p>

<p class='c015'>The walk did her good. A fresh wind
was blowing, that cooled the hot cheeks of
the troubled lady. In the air was something
of rest that soothed her, and it was in a more
equable frame of mind that she returned
home.</p>

<p class='c015'>At the door of 37, Beaconsfield Gardens,
she became conscious that something unusual
was agitating the inmates. A loud, angry
voice reached her, muffled by intervening
doors—a voice she seemed to recognise; and
when, in answer to her ring, Müller opened
the door, his face was flushed and his manner
agitated.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, blease,” he gasped, when he saw her,
“I am glat that you, matam, hafe come.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Here it is a voman asking you to see, and
ven I say you are not <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">zu Haus</span></i>, she <em>schimpf</em>
and cry, and vill not go avay.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Prudence’s heart stopped beating, and she
caught the door-post to save herself from
falling.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where is she, Müller?” she gasped
faintly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I did show her into the morning room,”
said Müller, “ven she say that avay she vill
not go; but therein she vill not remain, but
valk into the hall and calls for you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Before he could say any more, there
appeared before the shocked eyes of Prudence
a vision of good Mrs. Brown, flushed, dishevelled,
her bonnet to one side. With
unsteady gait, she lurched down the hall, and
confronted the trembling lady.</p>

<p class='c015'>“So you’ve come at larst,” she said; “nice
way to keep a ’spectable woman awytin
for you. S’pose I’ve nothin’ better to do
than sitting ’ere?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What do you want with me, Mrs.
Brown?” asked Prudence, in an agitated
voice.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Wot d’ I want with you? Well, I likes
that. Wot do I want, she sez! I want
to know wot d’ you mean by sending a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>’spectable married woman for the keep of that
there byby a cheque as she can’t get no
money for? Eh? Tell me that? A bloomin’
shame, I calls it; but you just fork out
that thirty pounds as you howe me, or I’ll
’ave the law of you,” said good Mrs. Brown,
loudly but indistinctly.</p>

<p class='c015'>Prudence was miserably conscious that two
or three heads were peering over the balustrade
from the landing above.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Will you come in here, please,” she said
as firmly as she could, “and tell me exactly
what is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“The matter?” queried Mrs. Brown, as
she lurched against her. “Matter enough!
What did you go for to send me a cheque
at all, wen I told you I wouldn’t ’ave no
cheques?”</p>

<p class='c015'>By this Prudence had got her into the
morning room, deserted, for a wonder, and
closed the door.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Now,” she said tremblingly, “what is all
this about, and what do you mean by coming
here and making such a noise? I am sorry
I sent you a cheque, but I quite forgot you
told me not to, and it is all right; there is
nothing wrong with it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Nothin’ wrong! Wy wot d’ you take me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>for, a-sendin’ me a cheque as no one ’ll
change?” said Mrs. Brown. “Nice conduck
of a female as calls ’erself a lydy, a-sending
of a pore woman to one public hafter another,
an’ not one o’ the lot ’ll change the thing!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Let me see it,” said Prudence, bewildered.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Brown glared rather unsteadily at the
speaker for a minute, and then fumbled in her
bag. After many futile dives, she at last
turned out the contents on the table. There,
amidst papers, a thimble, sixpence in coppers,
some pawn tickets, a half-crown, a reel of
cotton, a stump of blue pencil, and various
other odds and ends, was the letter of Prudence,
with her cheque, now very crumpled
and dirty, protruding.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Calls erself a lydy,” pursued good Mrs.
Brown, “an’ sends me that!” Here she
banged the cheque on the table.</p>

<p class='c015'>Prudence, from force of habit, had crossed
the cheque and marked it “not negotiable,”
as the family solicitor, when first she had the
handling of money, had instructed her always
to do.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I am sorry,” she said, “the cheque is
crossed, and that is why they would not
change it. It should be passed through a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>bank. If you will wait here quietly for a
moment, I will write you another.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Good Mrs. Brown at first seemed indisposed
to allow Prudence to leave the room at
all. “Give me my money,” she said; “I
don’t want none o’ your cheques. Money
down’s the thing for me!”</p>

<p class='c015'>A vast amount of explanation was required
before she seemed to grasp the sense of what
the unhappy lady was saying. Then she
suddenly sat down on a chair and burst into
tears, much to Miss Semaphore’s alarm and
distress.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You won’t try to starve the blessed
hinfant,” she said, “and rob a pore woman of
’er ’ard earned money?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Prudence earnestly assured her she would
not, that nothing was farther from her intentions.
She apologised again and again about
the unlucky cheque, and implored her unexpected
visitor to be calm, to be patient for
one moment while she ran upstairs to fetch
her cheque book.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Brown, however, followed her to the
door, and protested huskily against the
younger Miss Semaphore’s “giving” her
“the slip.”</p>

<p class='c015'>As poor Prudence escaped, she had the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>misery of seeing the heads of Mrs. Whitley,
the medical woman, and even of the stately
Mrs. Dumaresq herself, hastily withdrawn
from over the balustrade on the first landing.
Every minute seemed an hour until a fresh
cheque was made out, and good Mrs. Brown,
grasping it tightly in one hand, had gone off
to negociate it after a deal of explanation.
Prudence felt quite sick with agitation and
apprehension.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I really almost believe,” she said to herself,
“I really am inclined to think that
Mrs. Brown must have been drinking.”</p>

<p class='c015'>A dreadful uneasiness as to how Augusta
might be faring weighed heavy on her heart.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I will certainly go to-morrow and see the
place,” she resolved, “and if I do not like it,
I’ll take Augusta away.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Her spirits drooped at the prospect of an
impending conflict with good Mrs. Brown,
for even if her thoughts wronged the
respectable woman, that afternoon’s experience
showed that the lady in question had
another side to her character besides that
observed by Prudence at London Bridge
Station.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Next morning Prudence, after a restless
night, was up betimes. Never in the past
had the placid, good-natured spinster known
sleeplessness, except in a very modified form.
Since Augusta’s misfortune, however, that
was changed. She thought more than she
ever had thought in her life, and constant
anxiety was making her face look drawn and
worn. Her brief triumph at having got her
sister safely out of the house had vanished
with the unexpected and unwelcome visit of
“good Mrs. Brown.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Wearily tossing on her bed, waiting for
the dawn, she pictured that mistress of a
comfortable home, pursuing her with threats;
while babies, cheques, Mrs. Dumaresq, and
the medical lady whirled wildly past in a
waking dream.</p>

<p class='c015'>At four, she rose, and beguiled the weary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>hours until the breakfast bell rang, by watching
the gardener sharpening his scythe to cut
the grass, and observing the sleepy maids
unfastening the shutters of the opposite
houses, shaking mats, and washing the steps.
She wished to go then and there in search of
her sister, her anxiety and impatience grew
every minute, and she fretted, as we all have
done, at the restrictions that prevent one
paying a casual call at six in the morning,
and the laziness that fails to enforce the
running of trains the twenty-four hours
through.</p>

<p class='c015'>Not even a cab could she see. Many a
time had she opened her window, looked out,
closed it again, taken a novel, put it by,
looked at her watch, walked up and down,
re-arranged her hair, fidgeted, opened her
door, listened if anyone was moving, shut it
and sat down, before the welcome boom of
the gong, struck by Müller’s stout arm,
announced the first meal of the day.</p>

<p class='c015'>Poor Miss Prudence made but a dismal
pretence at eating. She knew that her queer
visitor of the previous evening was remembered
and discussed, and she felt that every
morsel of bread would choke her. She
crumbled a slice on her plate, drank a cup
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>of tea, and then rose hastily from table.
Consciousness of terrible guilt could scarcely
have made her more miserable than she,
good innocent creature, was at the moment.</p>

<p class='c015'>Guilty people usually have a certain hardness
of nature that makes them indifferent to
the opinion of others, while Prudence, with
all her woes upon her head, was a timid,
unsheltered, soft-hearted body, to whom an
angry or contemptuous glance was as bad as
a blow.</p>

<p class='c015'>By half-past nine she had donned a black
bonnet and mantle, and had left the house,
carrying in her hand an envelope on which
she had written “good Mrs. Brown’s” address.
She hailed a passing omnibus that was going
in the direction, and, still pursued by her
sombre thoughts, tried to imagine what she
should do with Augusta if, as she feared,
Mrs. Brown’s house was not the happy home
she had anticipated.</p>

<p class='c015'>Plummer’s Cottages were not easy to find.
No one knew where they, were; but then
every civilian of whom one asks the way in
London is sure to be a stranger, so Prudence
applied to a stalwart policeman.</p>

<p class='c015'>“If I was you, mum, I shouldn’t wenture,”
he said, “they’re a low lot down there.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>“But I must,” urged Prudence nervously.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, if you must, take the fourth to the
right, and then the second to the left, and
the first to the right again. That’s Barker’s
Rents. You walks straight past the Model
Dwellings, which models they are, and you’ll
find Plummer’s Cottages.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Prudence, having laboriously counted her
streets, followed his directions. The second
turn to the left brought her into a dingy byway,
and the first to the right again into a
slum. Barker’s Rents towered up to the sky,
and at the door of the Model Dwellings a
group of slatternly women were discussing
personal topics with much freedom, and a
running accompaniment of “sez he,” “sez I,”
and “sez she.”</p>

<p class='c015'>No. 42 was an inconspicuous cottage,
with a battered green door, reached by a
single step. Prudence knocked at it with
the handle of her umbrella without any
response. She repeated the summons, but
in vain, and, having shaken the door, which
resisted her efforts to open it, she endeavoured
to peep through the dingy window. Her
proceedings excited considerable interest
amongst the ladies standing at the Model
Dwellings, as indeed amongst all the residents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>in the neighbourhood, who came out by twos
and threes until at last, Prudence, turning
round, was surprised and alarmed to find
herself the centre of an unwashed and, to her
eyes, menacing crowd.</p>

<p class='c015'>“’Tis no good your rapping,” said a burly
woman, pushing her way through. “There
ain’t no one there. The ’ouse is empty.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Empty!” ejaculated Prudence. “Since
when?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“They cleared out last night like winking.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, but there must be some mistake. I
am looking for a Mrs. Brown.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You bet!” said the woman, addressing
the crowd, “she’s one o’ them. Nice lot she
must be to ’and ’er own flesh an’ blood hover
to Sal Brown.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The crowd signified approval of this view
by a series of hoots and cat calls.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But I don’t know what you mean,” cried
the frightened and bewildered Prudence, “I
want to find a Mrs. Brown, who told me her
address was 42, Plummer’s Cottages, and
now that I come here, I find the place shut
up and you say the woman is gone. Can
anyone tell me where to find her?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’ll tell ye fast enough,” said the burly
woman. “She’s in the lock-up, Sal Brown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>is; she’s to be brought up before the beak to-day
on a drunk and disorderly.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But good gracious! my sister! Where——where
is the child she was taking care
of?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh! so you <em>are</em> one o’ them. A nice
’uzzy you must be to give an innercent byby
hover to Sal. Blest if you’ll find it alive, an’
no doubt that’s wot you wants. The perlice
made a swoop on the lot last night, an’ they
say the Sercierty for the Prewention o’
Cruelty to Children’s carted ’em off somewhere.
I wish you just saw ’em, so I do.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Them? What do you mean by them?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“As if yer didn’t know! Wy, the hinfants
to be sure. The Sercierty took the whole
fifteen o’ them, an’ now they’re going to try
to find the parients. They’ll be glad to ’ear
of you. They’ll ’ave somethink to say t’
you wen they sees yer.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Fifteen infants! Why what do you mean?
I only know of one child that was given over
to Mrs. Brown to take care of. She wanted
to adopt it. She said she was a respectable
married woman, and would give it a comfortable
home.”</p>

<p class='c015'>A burst of jeering laughter greeted this.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Precious comfortable,” said a thin woman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>“with Sal on the booze! Wy d’you mean
to tell us you didn’t know she wer a reglar
wrong un?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“A wrong one?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, farmed kids and that?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t know what you mean,” protested
Prudence tearfully.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, y’are a deep ’un, or a softy, blest if
I know which, not t’ve found all about ’er
from the start, if yer not lyin’, as is most
likely.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But what am I to do?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Dunno. You go ’long to the perlice
station, an’ p’raps the bobbies’ll tell you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where is it?” asked Prudence wearily.</p>

<p class='c015'>Several of the women pointed out the
direction, and followed by a little procession
of interested but shock-headed observers,
who made unfavourable comments on her
manners, morals, and appearance, the younger
Miss Semaphore took her way, for the first
time in her life, to the police station, and
made tearful enquiries of a constable at the
door.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Step this way, ma’am,” said he.</p>

<p class='c015'>While the disappointed crowd hung about,
and, foreseeing no startling or tragic <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement</span></i>,
gradually melted away, Prudence was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>ushered into the presence of a severe official
seated at a table covered with neatly docketed
papers.</p>

<p class='c015'>The constable, a fresh-coloured young
fellow from the country, saluted.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Please, sir, this person’s called about the
Plummer’s Cottages Baby Farming Case.
Says she’s mother to one of the hinfants.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sister,” corrected Miss Semaphore timidly.
“I am not a married lady, my good
man.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Will you kindly state your business,”
said the inspector, after an awful pause, during
which he took no notice of the presence of
Prudence, but went on writing stolidly.</p>

<p class='c015'>Prudence told how a few days ago she
had entrusted her sister to the care of a
woman named Brown, and had paid her two
sums of twenty and thirty pounds respectively.
That now she found the woman had left the
address given to her, that the house was shut
up, and, having been told Mrs. Brown was
under arrest, she had come to the station to
make enquiries and to discover, if possible,
the whereabouts of her sister. The narrative
was told in broken words interrupted by
many sighs and tears.</p>

<p class='c015'>Inspector Smith had made a reputation in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>connection with baby farming cases, and he
looked on this Plummer’s Cottages business
as one of the worst transactions of the kind
he had ever come across. Sal Brown he
considered less guilty than the wicked and
unnatural parents who had delivered over
their offsprings to her. What he inwardly
designated the “crocodile tears” of Prudence
did not move him a whit, and he surveyed
her with manifest disfavour. She might of
course be a dupe, but he inclined to believe
her a criminal.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do you say that the child in question is
your sister?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But did you not tell the constable just
now that you were her mother?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh dear no! He misunderstood me. I
only said I had come to enquire about a
child.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But you must be aware that all the
children found at the woman’s house were
extremely young—infants in fact. None of
them were over two years of age.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My sister is”—Prudence hesitated—“extremely
young.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well,” said the Inspector doubtfully,
“of course I cannot compel you to speak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>the truth. They’ll do that elsewhere. The
babies are mostly in a terrible way, starved,
dirty, and diseased. We are trying to trace
their parents, as several names and addresses
were found in the possession of Brown, and
you would probably have been subpœnæd to
give evidence at her trial. Meantime the
children have been taken to the workhouse.”</p>

<p class='c015'>What all this portended Prudence scarcely
grasped. One fact, and one fact alone, stood
out luridly before her. Augusta was in the
workhouse.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh!” she gasped in dismay, “in the
workhouse! My sister in the workhouse.
Where is it? Let me go at once. I must
take her away.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think you had better not attempt to do
anything of the kind,” said the Inspector
stiffly. “The Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children has taken the matter up,
and you’ll hear more of it later. You had
better just leave the child alone. She is in
good hands now anyway, very different from
those you put her into. My advice to you is
to keep quiet. You’ll see her all right later
on, and may be you’ll have to tell your share
in the case.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My share in the case is easily told,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>poor Prudence. “As I explained to you
already, I thought I was placing her in a
good home, with a kind, respectable woman,
but it seems I was mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c015'>If anyone has formed an opinion that
another is wily, the simplest speech or action
tends to confirm it. In the heart-moving
accents of Prudence, Inspector Smith heard
only duplicity. In her open, though tear-stained,
countenance he read nothing but low
cunning.</p>

<p class='c015'>“It’s quite wonderful,” he said coldly, “to
see how easy it is to deceive people when it
is to their interests to be deceived; they ask
no questions and they are told no lies, and a
troublesome baby is got rid of, that’s how it
is.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, I did want to get rid of her for
a little time,” admitted Prudence, with the
characteristic foolish candour that so often
covers the innocent with suspicion, “because
it was not convenient to have her where I
live. If you knew the circumstances, sir, you
would feel for me. They are very peculiar
and extraordinary, but indeed I asked questions
and Mrs. Brown told me lies.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The Inspector looked at her under his
shaggy brows, he did not quite know what to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>make of her simplicity. She was either an
admirable actress or else—she seemed really
white and ill and frightened, but with that
kind of woman one never knew how much
was “fake.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Will you please give me your full name
and address,” he said.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Prudence Elizabeth Semaphore, 37,
Beaconsfield Gardens, South Kensington.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Condition?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sir.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Condition, married or single?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I am unmarried, as you must have heard
me say to the constable.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Unmarried, hem. Age?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Age?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, age. How old are you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That, sir,” said Prudence with dignity,
“is no concern of yours; I decline to answer.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well,” said the Inspector grimly, “I
won’t press the question. Perhaps you may
answer it later. That’ll do,” and with a nod
he dismissed her.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But the workhouse where my sister is,
where is it? How can I get there?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She is at St. Mark’s Workhouse, but you
had better leave her alone.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“Would you mind,” said Prudence pleadingly,
“writing down the name and the name
of the street where it is situated? I must go
there at once.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, you can remember well enough,”
said the Inspector rather gruffly. “St.
Mark’s Workhouse, Bush Street.”</p>

<p class='c015'>With this Prudence had to be content.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <span class='large'>MRS. DUMARESQ IN AN UNDIPLOMATIC CIRCLE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>When Prudence found herself in the street,
she looked in a bewildered fashion from
right to left, not knowing which way to turn.
The good-natured young constable pointed
out the direction of the workhouse, telling
her it was quite near, and thither she bent
her steps. Knowing nothing of the intricacies
of the neighbourhood, she walked some
considerable way before realising that she
was lost, and that her best plan was to take a
cab. Cabs, however, were few about there,
and she discovered one with difficulty. As
she drove towards the workhouse she had
leisure to reflect on the bewildering incidents
of the morning, and speculate on the condition
of mind and body in which she would
probably find Augusta.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“The poor dear,” she thought, “what she
must have gone through! Oh! what a
misfortune to have come across that terrible
woman. And she looked so nice, so clean,
so respectable. Thank Heaven, Augusta
was not with her very long.” She went
over in her mind her conversation with the
Inspector.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What a disagreeable man! He seemed
quite to doubt my word that Augusta was
my sister. Perhaps I had better say in
future that she is my half-sister. She does
look ridiculously young.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Suddenly poor Prudence bounded from her
seat. She had but just remembered something
the Inspector had said—something
scarcely noticed at the time amidst so many
conflicting anxieties and emotions.</p>

<p class='c015'>“We are trying to trace their parents, as
several names and addresses were found in
the possession of Brown, and you would
probably in any case have been subpœnæd
to give evidence at the trial.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Great Heaven!” she thought, “so there
is to be a trial.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The full meaning of the words burst suddenly
upon her. It should all come out—the
whole story. She saw herself in court,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>heckled, badgered, cross-examined, made
perhaps to contradict herself at every turn,
surveyed critically by the boarders at
Beaconsfield Gardens, who, of course, would
flock to hear the case. She would be flouted,
disbelieved if she told the truth, tripped up
and convicted of falsehood if she lied, accused
no doubt of perjury, perhaps of murder,
ordered to the cells to undergo terrible
and unknown penalties, while Augusta—the
only person who could prove her
innocence and good faith—Augusta was a
helpless, speechless infant, unable to testify
in her favour. Of law, of legal procedure, of
what a judge could or could not do, Prudence
was profoundly ignorant. All that was plain
to her was, that she could not produce her
sister in the flesh as known to and recognisable
by her acquaintances, and that no one
would credit her if she produced the baby
and said that was Augusta. Even at the
best, if no question as to her sister arose, no
suspicion of murder, how bad it looked to
have smuggled a child away, and given it to
such a person as Mrs. Brown to cruelly use.
Cold beads of perspiration stood out on the
poor woman’s forehead. No! she would not
be mixed up in it; she would not go into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>court at all; she would get back her sister and
flee far away from London, and Mrs. Brown,
and the medical lady. In agonised haste she
pulled the check string, and bade the cabman
drive back at once to the station. She
would tell the Inspector that she declined to
give evidence under any circumstances—surely
they could not force her to if she
refused—and bitterly she reproached herself
for her unpardonable stupidity in not having
done this at the time.</p>

<p class='c015'>She tumbled out of the cab, and made her
way like one distraught to the little office
where she had seen the Inspector. Alas! he
had just gone out. No one knew where
he had gone to or when he would return.
Prudence had therefore to content herself
with leaving a verbal message with a subordinate,
to the effect that nothing would
induce her to appear against Mrs. Brown or
anyone else, or to enter a court of law under
any circumstances. This done, she returned
to her cab with a mind rather more at ease,
and resumed her journey to the workhouse.</p>

<p class='c015'>Workhouse porters are not usually chosen
for their urbanity, and he of St. Mark’s was
no exception to the rule. “It is not visiting
day,” he said to her, “and you ought to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>know better than come bothering here.”
He was deaf to her appeals to see Augusta.
“It can’t be done,” he said. “You should
come on Thursday between three and six.
It’s no use your making a disturbance.”
As she still persisted, he lost his temper,
and told her she had better go, or he would
have her turned out.</p>

<p class='c015'>The frightened Prudence hurried back to
her cab, and, sobbing miserably, directed the
driver to South Kensington. Worn out by
the fatigues and excitements of the day, she
arrived at 37, Beaconsfield Gardens, in time
for dinner.</p>

<p class='c015'>She would have given anything not to be
obliged to put in an appearance at that
meal, but she did not dare to remain in her
room. Her fear of attracting notice was
morbid.</p>

<p class='c015'>The boarders, for a wonder, were discussing
Dickens as Prudence took her place at
table.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Dickens is an author I have never read,”
Mrs. Dumaresq was saying.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Really!” responded Major Jones. “Why
not?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My dear mother did not approve of his
works when I was a girl,” said Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Dumaresq, “and, since then, what I have
seen of his writings has not induced me to
form a different opinion.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But I never heard it said that Dickens
had written anything objectionable.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, objectionable! Well, not exactly
objectionable in the sense you mean,”
answered Mrs. Dumaresq; “that might not
matter so much, but he deals with people
who are not in our set.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It says in to-day’s paper that the
Princess drove over yesterday to see the
motor cars,” said Mrs. Whitley suddenly to
Mrs. Dumaresq.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now Mrs. Whitley spoke indistinctly, and
with a lisp, which no doubt accounted for
Mrs. Dumaresq’s unexpected reply, for that
lady said,</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, yes, to be sure; so she did. They
are dear old friends of ours. Such charming
people!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Whitley looked astonished. “I’m
afraid you don’t quite understand me,” she
said; “I spoke of the motor cars.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, ah! Yes, to be sure,” said Mrs.
Dumaresq, slightly embarrassed. “The
motor cars—yes, I have seen them.”</p>

<p class='c015'>There was a long pause, during which the
lady regained her self-possession.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“Have you heard from your sister, Miss
Semaphore?” asked Mrs. Dumaresq, after a
time, as she ate her soup.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, thank you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And how is she?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not so well—at least, better. I mean
she is not yet quite well, but is better than
she was.”</p>

<p class='c015'>What further embarrassing questions the
lady might have put Prudence could only
speculate, for, providentially, Mrs. Dumaresq
was appealed to by the medical woman for
her opinion on some hotly-contested question
of Government policy. This was being
discussed by Major Jones and Mr. Lorimer,
who, it has been said, like most gentlemen
that live in boarding-houses, were staunch
Conservatives. A new boarder had just
given utterance to deplorably Radical sentiments.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Dumaresq had not heard, and
politely requested information as to the point
at issue.</p>

<p class='c015'>“My husband,” said the wife of the new
boarder, “remarked that, in proportion to
their means, the poor are taxed far more
heavily than the rich, and he advocates
reversing this. What do you think?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>“Really,” said Mrs. Dumaresq with lofty
sweetness, “I have no opinion on the
subject. I know absolutely nothing of
politics.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh! Then you are a Conservative,”
said the new boarder’s wife abruptly. “I
have always noticed that when a woman
begins by telling me she knows nothing of
politics, it means that she is a Tory.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Dumaresq looked offended. “Well,”
she said, after a brief pause, “my sympathies
are naturally with the aristocracy, amongst
whom my life has been passed. In military
and diplomatic circles everyone is Conservative,
so if I have any bias, it is in favour of
my friends.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The wife of the new boarder happened,
unfortunately, to be an earnest woman, so she
did not let the matter drop.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But why,” she pursued, “should you, a
member of the great English middle-class,
set yourself to uphold a system inimical to
the interests not only of the poor but of your
equals.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The listeners felt the position to be
strained. No one had ever pressed a point
on Mrs. Dumaresq before, and all the ladies
thought the new boarder’s wife was audacious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>and ill-bred. She herself, however, was
quite at her ease, though eager and
interested.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Dumaresq smiled rather acidly. “I
can scarcely claim the privilege of belonging
to what you call ‘the great English middle-class,’”
she said. “My relations have not
been in that sphere.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But surely,” said the new boarder’s wife,
“you do not consider that you belong to the
working class? That would be absurd.
You are too modest. Why, business people
on such a very large scale as your relatives
might almost rank with professional men.
My husband comes from Northampton, and I
have often heard your brother spoken of as
one of the most well-to-do men in the town.
Does he keep on the pawnbroking business
still? There was some talk of his retiring
from that after he was elected Mayor.”</p>

<p class='c015'>For a moment Mrs. Dumaresq looked as
if she had received a blow. She went white
and red in rapid succession, then rallied, and
smiled artificially at the unconscious and
unconcerned wife of the new boarder.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I fancy you misunderstood the drift of
my remarks,” she said. “And so your
husband knows Northampton. Busy town,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>is it not? Yes, my brother does own—a—a—some
business houses there, that were left
to him as portion of the vast estate of—um—a
wealthy relative, and, I believe that,
finding them very profitable, he has allowed
them to be kept on. So many people
nowadays do not shrink from trade as they
used when I was young. This is a
democratic age, is it not?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why, I thought it was your father who
founded the business,” said the new boarder’s
wife; but Mrs. Dumaresq had just begun to
tell Mrs. Whitley of a sale of work that she
had been to that afternoon, which had been
opened by Her Royal Highness the Duchess
of York, and she failed to hear the observation.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was an uncomfortable silence. The
prestige of Mrs. Dumaresq was rudely
shaken. Then everyone began talking together,
while the medical lady meditated
questioning the new boarder’s wife later, and
finding out all she had to tell about the
family of Mrs. Dumaresq, whose superior
airs had more than once irritated her.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>When dinner was over, and the feminine
boarders had filed upstairs as usual, a fresh
shock awaited poor Prudence. There was
sudden great excitement in the street. A
dozen newsboys, with stentorian lungs, bellowed
up and down Beaconsfield Gardens
the words, “Extry Speschul—’orrible case—<em>Re</em>-volting
details,” alone being distinctly
audible.</p>

<p class='c015'>The women crowded to the window trying
to hear, and speculating what the sensation
might be. Major Jones went to the front
door and bought a copy of <cite>The Star</cite>, which
he kindly brought up to the drawing-room
for the benefit of the ladies.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, Major, what is it all about?” asked
little Mrs. Whitley eagerly, when Major
Jones entered the room.</p>

<p class='c015'>“A dreadful Baby Farming Case,” said
the Major. “Fifteen babies discovered in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>a horrible state of dirt and neglect somewhere
at the East End.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I thought it was a murder,” said the
medical woman, somewhat disappointed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, this is just as bad! Do read it,
please,” cried Miss Belcher, Mrs. Whitley,
and Mrs. Wilcox, who had just finished
pouring out tea.</p>

<p class='c015'>Major Jones rubbed his glasses with a
silk handkerchief, holding <cite>The Star</cite> tightly
under his arm the while. Then, having
adjusted his spectacles, and taken up a
position immediately under the gas, he read
in a quick, monotonous voice:</p>

    <div>“HORRIBLE BABY FARMING CASE!</div>
    <div class='c003'>REVOLTING DETAILS!!</div>
    <div>FIFTEEN HELPLESS INFANTS CONSIGNED TO MISERY AND STARVATION!!!</div>
    <div>SEARCH FOR UNNATURAL PARENTS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“At the Arrow Street Police Court to-day, before Sir
John Jenkins, Sarah Anne Brown, 50, residing at 42,
Plummer’s Cottages, Barker’s Rents, E., and variously
known as ‘The Scorcher,’ ‘Soothing Syrup Sal,’ ‘Amelia
Tompkins,’ ‘Mary Ann Martin,’ ‘Mrs. Ash,’ ‘Mrs. Fry,’
&amp;c., was charged with being drunk and disorderly, and
assaulting the police. Police-constable Brady X 2001
deposed to being on duty in Pitt Street last night at 9.30.
He saw the prisoner, who was the centre of a noisy crowd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>of roughs, dancing before the door of the ‘Bunch of
Grapes,’ from which she had been ejected. In her arms
she carried a sickly baby, and when requested to move
on, she threw the child at the constable, making use of
disgusting language. The child was severely bruised, and
when remonstrated with, the prisoner scratched the constable’s
face. She then flung herself on the ground and
kicked. So violent was she that it took four men to
bring her to the station, where the doctor discovered that
the child was suffering from the effects of neglect and
starvation. The wretched infant was immediately conveyed
to the headquarters of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children, whence an officer of the
Society was at once despatched to prisoner’s address. On
enquiries being made at her home—a miserable hovel—it
seems that no fewer than fourteen unregistered infants
were discovered, the place being in fact a baby farm on
an extensive scale. The children were in an indescribable
state of filth and misery. There was only one feeding
bottle on the premises, and that was half-filled with sour
milk. Two of the older children were gnawing a crust
of dry bread. All were nearly naked, being wrapped in
various old rags. A number of pawn tickets of recent
date for articles of infants’ clothing seemed to show that
their wearing apparel had been disposed of by the
woman Brown, who appears to have carried on an
extensive traffic in infants for some years. On the floor
of the principal room was a wretched, filthy, flock bed.
There was neither fire nor light in the house. The
unfortunate little sufferers were at once removed to St
Mark’s Workhouse, and provided with food and medical
care. Four of them were not expected to live.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The prisoner, who seemed to be still under the
influence of drink, made a long and rambling statement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>about a baby, a crossed cheque, and a lady, but she
was interrupted by the magistrate, who told her she
ought to be ashamed of herself. This was one of the
most disgraceful cases that had ever come before him.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Ramsden asked that the accused should be
remanded to enable the police to make enquiries, as a
further charge would be preferred against her, that she,
being an unlicensed person, had undertaken the charge
of fifteen infants under two years of age.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The magistrate accordingly desired the case to stand
over until the 18th. It appears that the police found
several names and addresses at the prisoner’s house,
which are supposed to be those of parents or other
relatives of the unfortunate little ones. They are diligently
following up these clues, and Sir John Jenkins
expressed a hope that the publicity given to the case
would induce all who could give evidence to come
forward.”</p>

<p class='c015'>As Major Jones concluded, there was a
stir and a sudden rush amongst the ladies;
Miss Prudence Semaphore had fainted.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <span class='large'>A DETECTIVE ON THE TRACK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Boarding-house life tends to make one
selfish; “each for himself and God for us
all,” is the boarders’ motto. Where people
come and go, drifting in and out like weeds
upon the tide, deep interests or affections
are rare, but even in boarding-houses men
are sometimes thoughtful, and women sympathetic.
This is especially true in cases
of illness. The medical lady and Mrs.
Dumaresq rushed to the assistance of Prudence
when she stumbled off the sofa in a
dead faint. She was conveyed to her room,
smelling-salts, strong brandy-and-water from
Major Jones’ private store, burnt feathers,
and other powerful but unpleasant remedies
were applied until she opened her eyes and
gasped:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where am I? What has happened?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Before anyone could answer, memory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>apparently came back to her, for she went
into a fit of the wildest hysterics.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There now! there now!” said Mrs.
Dumaresq soothingly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Don’t talk to her like that, or she will
be twice as bad,” observed Miss Lord in
a low stern voice. “Now, Miss Semaphore,”
she continued sharply, “that is quite enough.
Just you stop laughing and crying, or I
shall try the effect of a pail of cold water
on you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She evidently meant it, and with a few
gasping, choking sobs, Prudence subsided.
Though there were two or three violent
relapses, each was promptly checked in turn,
so that she allowed herself to be undressed,
put to bed, tucked in, and left quietly
weeping, until she fell asleep from sheer
exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c015'>Next morning she was too ill and unstrung
to rise. The consuming anxiety that urged
her to be up and doing, to recover her lost
sister and flee from London, worked her into
a fever. The medical woman, who, much to
the patient’s distaste, had established herself
in the sick-room, and ruled with a rod of
iron, absolutely refused to let her rise.
Seeing the papers, and reading or writing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>letters were likewise prohibited. Prudence
had neither the bodily strength nor the firmness
of character to resist. She simply wept
and moaned, and wrung her hands, and
swallowed all the nauseous doses the medical
woman prepared for her. Meantime, the
fever increased so rapidly, and the poor
creature was so prostrate, that Miss Lord
advised calling in Dr. Creedy, physician-in-ordinary
to the Misses Semaphore. Accordingly,
without consulting Prudence, Dr.
Creedy was sent for. He was a little, fat,
bald-headed man, of few words, and thought
Prudence very ill indeed. When he left her
room he had a long conversation with the
medical woman and Mrs. Dumaresq, pronounced
the patient to be suffering apparently
from the effect of shock, and enquired
where her sister was. Mrs. Dumaresq told
him Miss Semaphore had gone to the seaside
for a change, having herself been
seriously and mysteriously ill.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think she ought to be communicated
with,” said the doctor, “I should not alarm
her, but this may be a grave matter, and it
would be wise to let her know that Miss
Prudence is not very well. She might help
us to soothe her, for Miss Prudence has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>evidently some trouble on her mind. Unless
we can remove the cause of her anxiety, my
medicines will have little effect.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But we don’t know Miss Semaphore’s
address, doctor,” objected Mrs. Dumaresq.
“I believe she wrote yesterday to say she
was better, but her sister did not tell anyone
where she had gone to.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No doubt our patient will give it to
you if you ask her,” said the doctor. He
prescribed a composing draught, ordered a
certain course of treatment, which the medical
woman guaranteed to carry out, then took
his hat and his departure.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Dumaresq, like Miss Lord, loved
anything that gave her a little temporary
importance, so Dr. Creedy had no sooner
gone than she approached the bedside of
Miss Prudence, and said in her sweetest
tones:</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think, dear Miss Semaphore, that perhaps
your sister may be uneasy if she does
not hear from you. You know the doctor
says you are to make no exertion for a day
or two. I forget where you said she was
staying, but if you will give me her address,
I shall have much pleasure in writing to her
and telling her all the news.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>To the speaker’s intense alarm, she had
not concluded this apparently harmless sentence
when Prudence had a relapse so sudden
and violent that it at once brought the medical
woman on the scene. Without ceremony—her
manners had never pleased Mrs. Dumaresq—she
bundled the diplomatic lady into the corridor,
and left her reflecting bitterly that since
the new boarder’s wife had betrayed such
inconvenient knowledge of her family, Miss
Lord had been much less civil.</p>

<p class='c015'>After about twenty minutes the medical
woman joined her, and enquired abruptly:</p>

<p class='c015'>“What were you saying to her to set her
off like that again?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Nothing at all. I cannot account for it.
I only asked her for her sister’s address that
I might write to her. You heard the doctor
say she ought to be told how ill Miss Prudence
is.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Look here,” exclaimed the medical woman,
“this is more of the mystery about her sister
which I feel persuaded is at the bottom of her
illness. You shouldn’t have mentioned her
at all, and the woman in such a state of
nerves. I wish I could find out what really
is the matter. It seems to me to be all of
a piece.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>“Oh! I don’t believe it has anything to
do with her sister,” said Mrs. Dumaresq,
offended. “Why, she went off in a dead
faint last night when no one was speaking
of her sister. I thought at the time it was
something in that case Major Jones was reading
out that affected her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“About the baby farming woman?” asked
the medical woman. “Why, what earthly
effect could that have on her? She could
have nothing to do with that.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I confess,” said Mrs. Dumaresq, “I don’t
see exactly how it could, but I’m persuaded
there is some connection between the two.
Did you notice her face when he began to
read? No? Well, I did, and I never saw
horror more plainly depicted on a human
countenance. I have been thinking matters
over, and putting two and two together. Do
you remember the extraordinary tipsy woman
that called before dinner on Tuesday? I am
certain I heard her say something about a
cheque and bringing back a baby. I happened
to be going upstairs at the moment,
as you may recollect, and stopped on the
landing to tie my shoe string.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, that’s absurd on the face of it,” said
the medical woman. “Miss Semaphore is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>a perfectly respectable woman, and not likely
to be mixed up with people of that kind.
Why I was on the stairs at the same time,
and I did not hear a word of this; there was
certainly something said about a cheque, but
not about a baby.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But I beg your pardon,” said Mrs.
Dumaresq with asperity, “perhaps your
hearing is not as good as mine. I certainly
heard the woman say threateningly she would
bring back the child, or the infant, I forget
which word was used, if something were not
done.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“They are charitable,” reflected the medical
woman, “perhaps they subscribe to a
home or institution, and this was some tipsy
pensioner.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Perhaps so,” said Mrs. Dumaresq oracularly,
“time will tell.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I’m certain she is upset about her sister’s
mysterious illness.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And I’m certain she is upset about
that woman’s visit, and that there is some
connection between it and the case in the
papers. I have an instinct in such matters.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Take care it does not mislead you,” said
the medical woman. Mrs. Dumaresq again
noticed bitterly that her friend was much less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>deferential since the new boarder’s wife had
spoken so abruptly of her brother.</p>

<p class='c015'>Whatever the cause of the younger Miss
Semaphore’s illness, there was no doubt
that it had alarmingly increased since
Mrs. Dumaresq injudiciously questioned her.
Fever, extreme excitability, restlessness, and
a tendency to delirium, all manifested themselves,
and it was only when a composing
draught had been administered, that the
patient sank into a troubled slumber. As she
sat watching her, the medical lady heard a
slight knock at the door, and opened it
cautiously.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was Mary the maid.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Please ’m,” she said, “there’s a gentleman
in the ’all wanting to see Miss Prudence
Semaphore.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What does he want with her?” asked the
medical woman surprised. “Did you tell
him she was ill?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Please ’m, I don’t know. I did tell him
she was ill, but ’e said ’e should see ’er
whether or no.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I shall go down to him,” said the medical
woman with dignity, and she went.</p>

<p class='c015'>“My good sir,” she began, “Miss
Semaphore is extremely ill, and must on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>no account be disturbed. If you have any
message for her, I shall be pleased to deliver
it when she is strong enough to attend to
business.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I come from Scotland Yard, madam,”
said the man respectfully, “and my business
is with Miss Semaphore herself. I shall not
detain her long, but I must see her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Quite impossible,” said the medical
woman with decision. “The doctor would
never allow it. She is extremely restless and
feverish, and has just been given a sleeping
draught, so that it would be most dangerous
to rouse her. But what do you want with
her?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She is required to give evidence in a
case.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Her conversation with Mrs. Dumaresq
flashed through the mind of the medical
woman. Could it be that her theory was
right after all? Without considering what
she was saying, she asked with an air of
confidence and knowledge:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is it the baby farming case?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes,” said the stranger.</p>

<p class='c015'>“My good gracious heavens!” said the
medical woman, sitting down abruptly and
heavily on the hall chair. “Who would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>have thought it? What has <em>she</em> to do with
the case?” she asked insinuatingly, but the
stranger from Scotland Yard had already
repented saying “yes,” and replied:</p>

<p class='c015'>“I really can tell you nothing about it,
madam, my business is entirely personal to
Miss Semaphore.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, she cannot see you, you know,”
repeated the medical woman. “I am nursing
her, and will not take the responsibility. Can
you not call again?”</p>

<p class='c015'>The stranger hesitated.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I suppose I shall have to. When do
you think she will be able to receive me?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“If she has a good night, and is kept
perfectly quiet to-morrow, she may be able
to see you next day, but I can’t answer for
it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Very well,” said the man, “I will call
again the day after to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The medical woman belied the statement
that great bodies move slowly, for she broke
the record in speeding to Mrs. Dumaresq’s
room. She had scarcely patience to wait
for a “come in” in reply to her agitated
knock, when she burst out with:</p>

<p class='c015'>“I do believe you were right after all.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How? What do you mean? About
what?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>“About that baby farming case. A detective—a
detective”—and she paused to observe
the look of horror that the face of Mrs.
Dumaresq assumed at the word—“has just
been here from Scotland Yard to see Miss
Semaphore. I told him she was too ill,
and asked his business. He said she was
required to give evidence in a case, and
when I said, ‘Is it a baby farming case?’ he
said ‘Yes.’”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I knew it,” said Mrs. Dumaresq, clasping
her hands with fervour. “I knew it from
the very moment I saw her face of guilt and
terror. Oh! to think that I should be in
the same house with such a woman. As sure
as you stand there, this address will get into
the papers, and what will become of us? If
my friends see it, I am lost.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The two women stood looking at each
other blankly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The best thing to do,” said the medical
woman, “is to go to Mrs. Wilcox, tell her
our suspicions, and insist on this—this person
being moved the very first moment she
is fit.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“It is horrible, horrible,” ejaculated Mrs.
Dumaresq. “When do you think she will
be able to go?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>“Not for a couple of days, I fear,” said the
medical woman. “It is better to say nothing
about this detective to her. It will only
agitate her and throw her back, and spoil
the chance of her speedy recovery, which, of
course, we must promote in every way.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My position,” said Mrs. Dumaresq, “is
horrible. The idea of knowing such people!
What will my friends say?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What will all our friends say?” exclaimed
the medical woman abruptly. “We are every
one in the same position. It will be an
awful scandal, and the worst of it is, that I
fear this is not the whole story. You take
my word, there is more to come out. I had
my suspicions from the first, but I am naturally
good-natured, and could not bring myself
to believe them. Every day, however, confirms
their truth. A woman who could for so
long deceive us as to her real character, a
woman who led me, <em>me</em>, to look on her as,
at worst, a harmless fool, and was all the time
mixed up with police and criminals and baby
farmers, is capable of anything.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then you think she is?—she has?”
queried Mrs. Dumaresq breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I shan’t say what I think just yet,” said
the medical woman. “I will make some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>searching enquiries first, and if my worst
fears are confirmed, I will reveal all to Mrs.
Wilcox this evening, and let her take action.
My dear, we are lucky if we find she has
been guilty of baby farming alone.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <span class='large'>A COUNCIL OF WAR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>That evening there was a mysterious private
gathering of ladies in Mrs. Dumaresq’s room,
chosen because it was the largest. To it
came first of all the medical woman, bursting
with importance and revelations. Mrs.
Whitley, Mrs. Dumaresq herself, and the
specially invited Mrs. Wilcox made up the
conclave.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Wilcox was nervous and agitated.
She felt sure the medical woman had something
dreadful to tell her, and whether that
something related to the contagious nature
of Miss Prudence Semaphore’s illness, or to
something darker but less infectious, she did
not know.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, ladies,” she began nervously, as by
Mrs. Dumaresq’s request she seated herself,
“what have you to say to me? I hope,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>she added, turning to Miss Lord, “that your
patient’s illness has not taken a serious
form?”</p>

<p class='c015'>There was an awful pause. The medical
woman knew when she had got a good thing,
and was in no hurry to begin.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is it—is it diphtheria?” quavered Mrs.
Wilcox.</p>

<p class='c015'>Still the medical woman sat silent, with
every eye fixed on her.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, do tell us! Tell us the worst,”
pleaded Mrs. Wilcox. “Is she going to
die?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She will live,” said the medical woman
solemnly. “She will live—to die on the
scaffold.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gracious Heavens!” exclaimed everyone
simultaneously.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, ladies. To die on the scaffold. I
repeat it. Prudence Semaphore is, I fear—a
murderess.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Wilcox screamed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Miss Lord, Miss Lord,” she cried.
“Pray be careful. Do not say such dreadful
things. Miss Semaphore and her sister came
to me with the highest recommendations, and
you really—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Aye,” said the medical woman, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>stately and awful triumph, “she came with
her sister—where is her sister now?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“At the seaside somewhere, I suppose.
She did not leave me her address,” said Mrs.
Wilcox weakly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“At the seaside you suppose,” echoed the
medical woman with fine scorn. “No, my
dear madam, she is dead—and Prudence
Semaphore murdered her—murdered her in
this very house. Oh, you need not look at
me like that. I’ve not spoken until I have
traced every link in the chain of crime.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What did I say?” interposed Mrs.
Dumaresq.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What did I say from the very first?”
She looked round appealingly at Mrs.
Whitley. “I said I hoped she had not been
murdered. You remember I used those
very words.”</p>

<p class='c015'>No one heeded her, for everyone was
looking at the medical woman, as she gloated
over the sensation she had caused.</p>

<p class='c015'>“For pity sake, tell us all—all in strict
confidence,” gasped Mrs. Wilcox. “What
Captain Wilcox will say, I really cannot
imagine.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well,” said the medical woman, “I had
my suspicions front the first, but they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>vague. I felt that something was wrong, but
did not know what that something was.
The confusion of manner of Prudence
Semaphore, her refusal to say plainly what
ailed her sister, her reluctance to call in a
doctor, and the extraordinarily small amount
of nourishment she provided for her, were all
remarkable. Then she would let no one see
her. She put you off, Mrs. Wilcox, and she
burst into quite a rage when, in the interests
of humanity, I desired to visit the poor
neglected sufferer. No doubt by that time
Miss Semaphore was beyond human help, for
now I recall, there was an indescribable air of
guilt about that unhappy woman, and she
showed a ferocity of character for which I
had not given her credit. Still, I said
nothing. Then came the discovery that Miss
Semaphore had disappeared. That threw me
off the scent for a time. I am always disposed
to think as well of other people as
possible, and while her leaving the house so
suddenly and mysteriously seemed to point to
her having a dangerous and possibly infectious
illness, and being smuggled out of the
way by Prudence, I did not seriously think
she was dead. Our search of the room
revealed nothing. The renewed calm of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>manner shown by that wretched creature, and
the plausible story she told of her sister
having gone to the seaside, I confess, lulled
my suspicions to sleep. The story was
queer, but it was not too improbable. Then
came the visit paid Prudence by a drunken
woman, who insisted on seeing her, and made
such an uproar in the hall. Mrs. Dumaresq
declares that she heard her say something
about a cheque and an infant—”</p>

<p class='c015'>“So I did,” corroborated Mrs. Dumaresq.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well I didn’t catch the words, but events
have proved that you were right. Next
followed”—she hesitated.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Her fainting,” said Mrs. Whitley.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, her fainting suddenly in the drawing-room,
when Major Jones was reading out
something about that horrid baby farming
case. I did not connect these events, Mrs.
Dumaresq did.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes,” said Mrs. Dumaresq, with modest
triumph. “I observed her face of terror,
and remembering what the woman had said,
I put two and two together.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, you mentioned the matter to me,
and I confess I was sceptical. My suspicions
ran in a different groove, but it now seems
that we were both right.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>Mrs. Wilcox and Mrs. Whitley gasped
simultaneously.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You know some of what followed,” said
the medical woman, addressing Mrs.
Dumaresq. “This afternoon a man called
to see that wretched criminal. I, suspecting
nothing, went down to see him and ask
his business, for she had just taken a
sleeping draught. He told me—.” The
medical woman paused to gain her full effect.
“He told me that he was a detective from
Scotland Yard, and that his business with
Miss Prudence Semaphore was personal and
private. Mrs. Dumaresq’s words flashed on
me like a thunderbolt, and quite suddenly I
asked him, as if I knew all about it, if he
wanted to see her in connection with the
baby farming case, and he said ‘Yes,’—he
said ‘<em>Yes.</em>’—I expect he saw then he had
made a mistake, for I could not get another
word out of him after that, but he is to call
again the day after to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The horror of Mrs. Wilcox and Mrs.
Whitley could not be expressed. Mrs.
Dumaresq listened with the calm air of one
who has been in the secret all along.</p>

<p class='c015'>“When I saw,” said the medical woman,
“that Justice was upon her track, that she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>was mixed up with detectives and baby-farmers,
all my former suspicions came back
with a rush, but I felt the necessity for being
calm and just. I remembered the curious
circumstances I have mentioned, and also the
queer relapse she had to-day when Mrs.
Dumaresq asked for her sister’s address,
finally saying she did not know. The whole
thing was as plain as possible. Her sister
had disappeared, because she had been somehow
made away with. No doubt there were
circumstances in the past life of Prudence
Semaphore that she dreaded coming to her
knowledge, for we all know how particular
poor dear Miss Semaphore was. Still, I
resolved to search, to enquire before I
decided. I told Mrs. Dumaresq about the
detective, and then I began a rigorous
investigation, beginning quietly with the
servants.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But perhaps her sister really is at the
seaside somewhere,” suggested Mrs. Wilcox.
“All this is very shocking about the
detective and the baby farming; but Miss
Semaphore may be alive and well, for all
that proves to the contrary.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Wait till you hear,” said the medical
woman, shaking a solemn finger at Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Wilcox. “First of all, I made cautious
enquiries from the servants. Mary tells me
that from the day Prudence reported that
Miss Semaphore was ill, she was never
permitted to enter her room. Never saw her
again, in fact. She tried to get in, but the
door was always locked. This, too, was my
own experience. Then something was said
about a letter having come for Prudence from
her sister. Müller and Mary both know
Miss Semaphore’s handwriting, and they
agree that to their knowledge no such letter
has been delivered here. I next enquired as
to whether anyone had seen Miss Semaphore
leave the house. It was unlikely that an
invalid, probably still weak from illness,
should be able to get downstairs and out of
the house unobserved. Besides, there was
the question of luggage. She could hardly
have gone and taken nothing with her, not
even a change of dress. But no one saw
her. I then put on my bonnet, went out and
spoke to the men on the two nearest cab
ranks. They all agree in saying that none
of them took up a lady fare, or two ladies,
with or without luggage, on the Tuesday,
from this house. Major Jones tells us he
saw someone, who he is sure was Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Prudence Semaphore, and alone, crossing
the road hastily near Tate Street. That
would have been shortly after dinner on
Tuesday evening. It seems absolutely plain,
therefore, that Miss Semaphore did not leave
the house at all.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But we saw her empty room that night,”
said Mrs. Whitley. “We saw her empty
bed. She must have gone some time before
we went upstairs to visit her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My theory is,” said the medical woman,
“that she was then concealed in that very
room.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But where? Not in the wardrobe, for
we opened that, nor under the bed, for we
looked there, and there really was no place
else.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, yes, there was. You remember that
the very next day, I think, Prudence sent
away two boxes, ostensibly full of her sister’s
belongings. Now my theory is, and time
will prove whether I am not right, that in
one of those boxes, the big grey one, bound
with iron, was the body of Miss Semaphore!”</p>

<p class='c015'>By this time the medical woman’s hearers
were trembling in every limb.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How awful!” quaked Mrs. Whitley.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>“Why it is just like that East End tragedy.
I forget the name—when a woman—no, a
man, was taken away dead in a box.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“This is a serious accusation,” said Mrs.
Wilcox, after a time of digestive silence,
“and it doesn’t seem to me to be proved.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Doesn’t it?” enquired the medical woman
indignantly. “Well, I presume you’ll believe
it when you see the poor creature dead
before you, and are called on to identify her
remains, as I have no doubt you will be.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But Miss Prudence is really so gentle;
besides, what motive could she have for
killing her sister?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Gentle? A woman—a hypocrite like
that, with her baby-farmers and detectives
after her? Don’t tell me! And as for
motives, it seems plain enough that she may
have had several that we cannot guess at.
Mary tells me the Semaphores had a violent
quarrel about a fortnight ago, and probably
that decided her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, they often quarrelled. Poor Miss
Semaphore, you know, was trying enough at
times, but Miss Prudence never bore malice.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, Mrs. Wilcox, it seems to me you
think she is a plaster saint, and if so, there
is no use my saying anything more—but I
warn you. Time will tell.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“Indeed, I don’t,” said Mrs. Wilcox
hastily. “I think the whole affair is terrible
and disgraceful enough on the face of it, and
the sooner I get Miss Prudence Semaphore
out of the house, the better. I must speak
to Captain Wilcox at once. But then
murder—. No, I can’t believe it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, if you are going to risk allowing an
infamous criminal to escape justice, a Cain
whose hands are dyed in her sister’s blood, I
confess I am surprised at you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But think of the disgrace to the house,”
pleaded Mrs. Wilcox. “It will be put in the
papers, and we shall be ruined, and you
know, after all, Miss Lord, we are not quite
sure. Miss Semaphore may be alive and
well somewhere, and what fools we should
look if we made a fuss, and then she turned
up all right.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She never will turn up,” said the medical
woman gloomily. “There never was a
clearer case of circumstantial evidence. It
doesn’t take a Sherlock Holmes to piece it
together.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But what do you want me to do?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think that as I have placed all the facts
before you, your duty is to inform the police
at once. You are the head of this house,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>and if you sanction such goings on, it is no
place for respectable people.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Wilcox wrung her hands despairingly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I appeal to you, ladies,” she said,
addressing Mrs. Dumaresq and Mrs. Whitley,
“to consider that if Miss Semaphore is alive,
we might, by saying a word, lay ourselves, all
four, open to an action for libel. It may be
as Miss Lord says; still, until things develop,
until we know a little more about this trial
and the baby farming, and the connection of
Miss Prudence with it all, it is better to be
silent, and get her away peaceably. Even
if nobody saw Miss Semaphore leave, there
is no proof that she did not slip out
unobserved, though I grant it seems
unlikely.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do as you wish,” said the medical woman
in a towering rage. “I will be no party to
these concealments. My duty is clear, and
however painful it may be, I will do it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But the libel, Miss Lord,” suggested
Mrs. Whitley. “What Mrs. Wilcox says is
true. If Miss Semaphore turns up, her sister
may prosecute you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>This rather sobered the medical woman.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well,” she said, more conciliatingly,
“what do you suggest should be done?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>“I think,” said Mrs. Dumaresq, “I think
it would be more diplomatic to wait until this
trial, or whatever it is, comes off. If Miss
Semaphore is alive, I should think it certain
she will turn up at it. Or perhaps, indeed,
the suspicion of the authorities has already
fallen on Prudence. We don’t really know
why the detectives are after her. Let us
wait. Let us go to that trial and hear what
comes out. If she does not clear herself of
this charge, whatever it may be, and if her
sister does not put in an appearance, I think
it might be well for you, Mrs. Wilcox, to
suggest to the prosecuting counsel that he
should cross-examine her as to her sister’s
whereabouts. Then, if she cannot give satisfactory
replies, and if anything to her
disadvantage comes out, she will probably be
suspected, and the whole affair will be gone
into without our making ourselves responsible
in any way.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“That,” said Mrs. Wilcox, “I consider to
be an excellent idea. And now, ladies, I
beg of you not to let a word of all this escape
you. In a house like ours, one cannot be
too careful. Until we really know the truth,
there is no use in telling anyone what we
think. Will you all promise me to be silent
about it?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>Mrs. Dumaresq and Mrs. Whitley agreed,
and after some persuasion a reluctant consent
was won from the medical woman, who
promised to hold her tongue, until after the
trial, any way.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <span class='large'>NOTICE TO QUIT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>With the curious intuition common to the
sick, Prudence felt that something was
wrong. There was an atmosphere of unrest
about her.</p>

<p class='c015'>She noted the frown on the brow of Mrs.
Wilcox and the hardness of her tone when
she asked her how she felt, and if she
thought she would be able to sit up for a
while to-morrow, though Mrs. Wilcox did
her best to speak in her natural voice.</p>

<p class='c015'>She remarked the averted face of her old
enemy, the medical woman, but she was too
prostrate to heed them, or to enquire if
anything unpleasant had occurred.</p>

<p class='c015'>She did not seem to mind much what
happened now. Justice was probably on her
track. She was a criminal hiding from the
law. She would be hunted down, exposed,
put to public shame. Augusta—her poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Augusta—how was she? In what condition
would she be found? Tears of sorrow and
weakness gushed from the eyes of the
afflicted lady, but the rest and quiet and the
absence of fresh agitation gradually calmed
her nerves, and she had leisure to reflect on
her course of action. There was nothing for
it but to come forward, if compelled, and
speak the whole truth. She had had enough
of subterfuges and prevarications. She would
tell her story—they might believe it or
not as they liked. She thought, in the
apathy of despair, they probably wouldn’t—time
would tell, for surely Augusta, if ever
she became able to speak, would confirm her
testimony—granted she had not lost her
memory of the events connected with her
previous life. There would be two or three
years to wait probably, but that could not be
helped. She might, meantime, be cast into
prison. For that she was prepared. With
the courage of despair she braced herself to
meet whatever fate might have in store for
her. At any rate, it could not be worse than
the tortures she had already endured.</p>

<p class='c015'>When, two days later, the detective from
Scotland Yard called, she was able to receive
him in Mrs. Wilcox’s sanctum, for that lady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>would not suffer him to be shown into the
drawing-room. It was with a sense of
having been through all this before, that
Prudence read that “Victoria, by the Grace
of God, Queen,” summoned her to give
evidence at the Arrow Street Police Court,
on the ensuing Monday morning, “in the
case of the Queen <em>v.</em> Sarah Anne Brown,
otherwise,” &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c015'>Well, the worst had come, and she would
go through with it somehow. What awaited
her when the trial was over she did not
venture to speculate. That she had come
within the clutches of the law she did
not doubt, and her future loomed vague
and dreadful. Where could she go if she
escaped prison? Her name would be in
every paper, her story on every lip. Even
the lady who sold the Water of Youth had
never heard of a case of a grown, an elderly
person, being transformed into a baby by its
effects. She foresaw that it would be
generally believed that she had got rid of
Augusta, and that the baby was—but who or
what the baby might be considered was a
point on which she absolutely refused to
speculate.</p>

<p class='c015'>Long after the man from Scotland Yard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>had taken his departure, she sat in a sort of
stupor, taking no note of objects round her,
and unaware that she was alone, when she
was startled by the entrance of Mrs. Wilcox.</p>

<p class='c015'>The air of that lady was portentous.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Miss Semaphore,” she said, “there is
something I have been anxious to say to you
for several days back, but did not like to
speak while you were ill. Now, however,
that you are able to receive <em>visitors</em>”—with
sarcastic emphasis—“I think you are well
enough to hear what I have got to say. It
is this, that I desire that you will look for
accommodation elsewhere, and leave my
house at the very earliest opportunity.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“You mean to turn me out?” asked
Prudence in alarm.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Far be it from me to turn anyone out,”
said Mrs. Wilcox. “I merely request you
to leave.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“But why?” said Prudence timidly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why?” echoed Mrs. Wilcox almost in a
shriek. “Why? I think you had better
ask yourself that question, Miss Semaphore.
I have always tried to keep my house
respectable, and I must say, Miss Semaphore,
if I was to die for it, that I looked to you and
your sister to aid me in that endeavour,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>rather than to bring disgrace on a first-class
and well-conducted establishment. ‘Why?’
indeed!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I have had a great deal of worry lately,”
said Prudence, “quite without any fault of
my own, but neither my sister nor myself
have done anything to bring disgrace on
your establishment, Mrs. Wilcox.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No!” ejaculated Mrs. Wilcox angrily.
“Then what about all this baby-farming
business, and detectives from Scotland Yard
coming here looking for you?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Utterly confounded by such unexpected
knowledge on the part of her landlady, and
ignorant of how much more she might have
learned, Prudence could only gaze at her in
helpless bewilderment, while Mrs. Wilcox
stood nodding her head and grimly enjoying
the confusion she had occasioned.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I have been—I am in great trouble,”
Prudence stuttered; “but I am not to blame—no
one is really to blame, if you’d only
believe me. The whole thing was an accident.
If you know anything at all about it,
you must know it was an accident!”</p>

<p class='c015'>“An accident?” shrieked Mrs. Wilcox.
It flashed through her mind that perhaps
after all the medical woman was right.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>“Quite an accident,” said Prudence.
“Simply an overdose. The bottle broke,
you see, so the poor dear made haste to
swallow the contents, and accidently took too
much.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I really think, Miss Semaphore,” said
Mrs. Wilcox very slowly, “I really think
your mind is wandering.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh no, indeed I’m not wandering. That
was how it happened, and of course after
that I had to get rid of the poor dear,
especially as I never dreamt you knew
anything about it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>More and more confirmed in her belief
that Prudence was either raving or confessing
a murder, Mrs. Wilcox spoke.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, without enquiring further as to
what has happened, or how it happened,
having no desire to be mixed up in a very
painful affair, I think, Miss Semaphore, we
had better part, and the sooner you can make
it convenient the better.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, do keep me until after Monday,”
cried Prudence, breaking down. “The trial
will be on Monday, and that will decide
what course I must take; but now I am ill, I
am not fit to undertake packing. I cannot
go.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>“I am sorry to insist, Miss Semaphore,
but go you must. I will tell Jane she is to
help you to pack. Even if I were willing to
keep you, Captain Wilcox is not, and in such
matters he is terribly severe. I really cannot
gainsay him. He says he will not have you
under this roof for forty-eight hours longer,
and would sooner forfeit payment for your
week’s board now due than let you stay.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Prudence got up and groped her way
blindly to the door.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Very well,” she said, turning on the
threshold. “Send Jane to me at once. I
will leave before dinner.”</p>

<p class='c015'>With the assistance of Jane, Miss Prudence
put her belongings together, dressed, and
desired the maid to call a cab. No one
came to the door to see her off; but, glancing
at the windows, she saw Mrs. Wilcox peeping
out from her sanctum, and Mrs. Dumaresq
and the medical woman from the window of
their respective apartments.</p>

<p class='c015'>With a heart full of bitterness, Prudence
turned away, and bade the man drive on.
Up one street and down another they went,
the unhappy lady taking no note of where
she was going, until she was roused from her
brown study by the cabman, who drew up,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>descended from his box, and thrust his head
in the window to ask where she wanted to
go.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I don’t know, cabman,” said Prudence
helplessly. “I am looking for apartments.
Do you know of any that are nice and
respectable?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why, yessem, I do,” said the man,
“which my wife’s own sister, she keeps ’em
in Victoria Crescent, an’ clean an’ respectable
they are, that I’ll hanswer for; an’ she cooks
splendid.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Then drive there, please,” said Prudence
apathetically, and fell back into doleful
musings, until the cab stopped at the
address.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mrs. Perkins, the cabman’s sister-in-law,
married to an ex-butler, was a kindly, cheerful
body, who willingly accepted a week’s
rent in advance in lieu of references. In her
sage-green parlour Prudence sat down with a
feeling of rest and privacy, to which she had
long been a stranger, and braced herself as
best she might for the ordeal before her.</p>

<p class='c015'>“My poor darling Gussie,” the goodhearted
creature murmured over and over
again. “What you must suffer! My dear
sister, what must you think of me for sending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>you to that dreadful woman? But I did it
for the best, I did it for the best.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The excitement of the move was a great
strain on Prudence in her weak state of
health; but Mrs. Perkins proved an admirable
nurse, and though quite unable to leave
her bedroom for the next few days, the
unhappy spinster rejoiced at being free from
the supervision of the medical woman.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <span class='large'>AT THE ARROW STREET POLICE COURT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Nervous people are generally too early, and
on the fatal Monday morning Miss Prudence
Semaphore, who was still weak and ill, but
meantime had found comparative repose in
her quiet and obscure lodgings, presented
herself at the door of the Arrow Street Police
Court almost as soon as it was opened. She
was dressed all in black, and with her white
face and long veil looked like a newly made
widow.</p>

<p class='c015'>The baby farming case had excited great
interest in the neighbourhood, where “good
Mrs. Brown” was a well-known personage,
and though three cases stood before it on the
list, already dirty drabs from the surrounding
alleys, with still dirtier infants clasped in their
arms, had gathered on the pavement in hope
of seeing the prisoner and witnesses arrive.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Prudence had the satisfaction of hearing
herself described as “the mother o’ one o’ Sal
Brown’s children,” and of being threatened
with personal violence by a brawny matron,
who shook her fist under the poor lady’s
nose, and exclaimed, in an access of virtuous
indignation, “I know your sort, I do,”
promising, if Prudence would come outside,
to give her “a jolly good ’iding.” At this
point a policeman interfered, and conducted
the terrified victim to a private room where
she awaited in misery the usher’s summons.</p>

<p class='c015'>Meantime the witnesses began to collect.
The various serjeants and detectives concerned
in the case, the spectators of Sal
Brown’s war dance when she used a baby as
a weapon, and others arrived singly or in
groups. Amongst the rest came a workhouse
matron, and an assistant in charge of the
infants concerned, since in accordance with
the usual procedure, the infants had been sent
to the workhouse while awaiting the trial of
Sal.</p>

<p class='c015'>The matron was a portly, red-faced woman
of fifty, with that brusqueness of manner
acquired by officials accustomed to deal with
those whom they consider their inferiors.
Her friend was a pale and highly genteel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>person who made many objections to appearing
in court at all. The children, miserable,
pinched objects, with the big, bright eyes,
long lashes, and weird faces of the starved,
were packed by twos and threes in perambulators
in charge of a couple of pauper women,
fifteen unhappy infants in all.</p>

<p class='c015'>Weirdest of the party, was the elder Miss
Semaphore, in a pink cotton frock, an infant’s
bib, and an old and often-washed white
shawl. Little Augusta was a singularly unprepossessing
baby.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Drat the child,” said the workhouse
nurse. “She has just the look of a little old
woman, and I never did see one of her age
that took such notice of everything a body
does. I declare to you I took a sip of her
milk just to see if it was sweet, and when I
turned round I caught her eye, an’ I’m blest
if she didn’t wink. It gave me quite a turn.
A real wicked wink it was, an’ when I gave
her the bottle if she didn’t push it away, and
wipe the top before she’d drink a drop.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“She was starved, nurse,” said her subordinate.
“That’s what it was. Them
children that is starved has a look and ways
as if they was ninety. Many a one of them
I’ve seen brought in here, so I knows the
kind.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>“Oh! this one couldn’t have been starved.
It was only two days in Brown’s place I
hear. They do say its mother is a lady, and
gave it to Sal with a hundred pounds in gold,
and told her to get rid of it as soon as
she liked. Sal went on the spree with the
money, an’ that’s how she was run in. The
neighbours said that child had not been long
with her. Look! it’s a deal plumper than
the others. They’re regular starved I’ll
allow, but this ’un has queer ways. Now to
give you an idear, the matron and me we
had a friendly glass of punch last night after
a ’ard day’s work, and the matron, she says
to me, as how she’d like to see the children in
the baby farming case, as there’s so much
interest took in it you know, it made her
curious, an’ so I brought her in to see ’em all
a laying in their cots. An’ this ’ere one
was awake, staring at us with all its eyes.
So matron, she stoops an’ says, ‘Ow wazzums?’
an’ kisses it, an’ the cretur it makes a
face at her, turns away its head, and pulls out
a bit of blue ribbon as was on a doll I gave
it, and makes signs to her to take it. Struck
all of a heap she was. ‘Watever does it
mean?’ sez she. ‘Wy take the blue ribbon,’
sez I, half jokin’, for I couldn’t believe it, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>the objeck looks at me and nods three times
very slowly, just as if to say ‘you’re right.’
It frightened me, it did.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“’Tis your imagination, nurse, that’s wot
it is.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Not it,” retorted the nurse. “Imagination
don’t trouble me, so it don’t; but I see
wot I see, and there’s no good a trying to
persuade me different. That child is queer.
Just look at it now a sucking its thumb and
listening to every word we say, and taking it
all in you’d think.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Augusta, her scanty downy hair brushed,
her nose and cheeks shining with recent
ablutions, certainly had something weird
about her, or so it seemed to both the
women. Her eyes had an elfish intelligence
that was startling. She looked as if at any
moment she might speak.</p>

<p class='c015'>That she understood was only too evident,
for she obeyed every direction given to her
when it was to her fancy. At times her
efforts to find a voice, to tell all she knew,
could not be mistaken, and inspired as much
fright and pity as the inarticulate cries of the
deaf and dumb.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What is she doing of now?” said the
subordinate suddenly.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Augusta had been looking at her fixedly
until she attracted her attention, and when
the eyes of the nurse and her assistant were
fixed on the elderly infant, they saw she was
making violent efforts to get up.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What is it, pet? What is it now?” said
the assistant soothingly. “What does my
precious want?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I vow and declare,” said the matron,
“that child is making signs as if she was
writing. Look at her finger, do. She makes
me nervous, she does. ’Tis no way for a
baby like that to go on.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How old would you say she was, nurse?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, ’bout a year I’d say, or fourteen
months.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Would you now? Well, p’raps she is;
but d’you know when first I saw her she
didn’t seem to look a month old. Queer,
wasn’t it? p’raps ’twas the light, but she do
seem a deal older now.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Wat an interest you take in her,” said
the matron. “Wy ’er more ’an the others?
Nasty little varmint she is I thinks myself.
She might be an ’undred by the looks of ’er.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Wot ken you expect from a pore little
neglected come-by-chance? She’s ’ad a bad
time, she ’as. I wish I ’ad ’er mother ’ere,
an’ I’d give ’er wot for, so I would.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>“Will you stop that talking, please,” said a
burly policeman, thrusting his head into the
room where the witnesses were assembled.
“They can ’ear you in court.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The voices fell immediately.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, there they are, poor little dears!”
said a new-comer, bustling in, a neighbour of
“good Mrs. Brown,” who had been called on
to give evidence as to the condition in which
the children were kept. “Let me see, there’s
Florrie and Joey and Ada and Rosy and
Tommie; yes, everyone of them, but where’s
the last child? The one Sal got all the dibs
with?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Here she is,” said the workhouse matron,
indicating Augusta.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No you don’t,” said the woman rudely.
“’Twas a new-born hinfant, it was. That
child’s a goin’ on two years old, or I’m a
Dutchman, an’ I never set heyes on her
before. She don’t belong to Sal’s little
lot.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The matron made an angry reply, which
Sal’s neighbour resented, and trouble would
have ensued, but that the big policeman interfered
once more and commanded silence.
Both parties appealed to him, but he would
listen to neither, and gruffly told them to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>“stow their talk, and keep their story till they
got into court.”</p>

<p class='c015'>While this went on in the waiting-room,
Prudence was sitting in an agony of apprehension
expecting the summons.</p>

<p class='c015'>At last the case of The Queen <em>v.</em> Brown
was called, and Sal was put forward on
remand charged with the criminal neglect of
certain infants under one year, committed to
her charge, and for that she, an unlicensed
person, did receive more than one such
infant, contrary to the regulations of the Act
25 Victoria, section 22, clause 4.</p>

<p class='c015'>An officer from the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children deposed
that the police had informed him of the
deplorable condition of the unhappy infant,
whom Sal was using as an offensive weapon
on the occasion of the arrest. He went to
the station where the woman had been
charged, obtained her name and address, and
proceeded to make enquiries. A graphic
description of Plummer’s Cottages followed,
and of the wretched objects found there—starved,
dirty, and miserable.</p>

<p class='c015'>Witness after witness was called to testify
to the children being left for hours without
food, fire, or attention. The children were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>formally exhibited. The workhouse matron
deposed to their condition when admitted.</p>

<p class='c015'>Finally, it was announced that the names
and addresses of parents or other relatives of
the children had been found, some of them
people of good position, and that they would
be brought forward to swear to their condition
when delivered over to the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was a thrill of excitement in court,
anticipative of scandals. People of good
position do not hand over babies to a Sal
Brown without strong reason. To the rustle
and stir succeeded a strained silence as
the usher called the name of “Prudence
Semaphore.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> <span class='large'>A SCENE IN COURT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Miss Prudence Semaphore, in after years
describing her sensations when placed in the
witness box, was accustomed to say she
didn’t know whether she stood on her head
or her heels. If any desire to experience
the feeling, without enduring the varied
miseries that a cruel fate inflicted on the
unhappy lady, let them, if unaccustomed to
public speaking, be called on for an afterdinner
speech. The swimming in the head,
the sea of faces dimly seen, the weakness in
the knees, dryness of the tongue and throat,
confusion of thought and general helplessness
experienced, will help them to realise her
emotions. The impossibility of dying suddenly
then and there, ere forced to break
silence, will appear a hardship, but they will
be spared the terror of having somehow
brought themselves within the clutches of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>law, that appalled Miss Prudence. Speechmaking
is not penal. Would that it were;
but a respectable spinster, mixed up in a
baby farming case, the only witness to her
truth and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ fides</span></i> a helpless, speechless
infant, can scarcely hope to clear herself
satisfactorily.</p>

<p class='c015'>Prudence knew that her story was wild
and improbable; her illness had further disheartened
her. She felt sure that no one
would believe her on her oath, and this conviction
gave a hesitation to her manner, an
uncertainty to her statements, that branded
her in the eyes of all as an audacious but
unskilful liar.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Come! she might ’ave told a better one
than <em>that</em>!” was the whispered remark in the
gallery when, in answer to a question, she
declared that the infant handed over by her
to the prisoner was her sister.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Do you mean your step-sister?” asked
the magistrate. “She is very much younger
than you.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, sir. She is my sister. My elder
sister.”</p>

<p class='c015'>There was a roar of laughter at this extraordinary
statement.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your <em>elder</em> sister?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>“Yes, your worship.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Are your parents living?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, your worship.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“When did they die?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“My mother died sixteen years ago, my
father three years later.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And yet you say this infant is your elder
sister?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, sir, my lord, your worship,” said
the weeping Prudence, “I assure you I am
speaking the truth. I know I can’t expect
anyone to believe me, but indeed it is
true.”</p>

<p class='c015'>There was movement and merriment at
the solicitors’ table, and a voice said in a
whisper,</p>

<p class='c015'>“Queer delusion! Mad as a hatter!”</p>

<p class='c015'>Prudence heard the words, and drew herself
up with some dignity.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No,” she said, “I am not mad; it is
no delusion. Will you allow me to make a
plain statement, your worship? The child I
handed to that wicked woman is my sister,
and is older than I. We bought a bottle of
the Water of Youth that we saw advertised
in the <cite>Lady’s Pictorial</cite>. She should have
drunk very little, but unfortunately she took
an overdose, and you may believe me or not,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>but I found her changed into the infant you
see in the middle of that same night.”</p>

<p class='c015'>A roar of laughter drowned her words.</p>

<p class='c015'>The counsel for the prosecution was very
stern.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I do not know, madam,” he said, “what
may be the state of your mind, though I
should advise your relatives to have it
enquired into, but we cannot have the time
of the court taken up in listening to such
ridiculous and impossible statements. Remember,
please, that you are on your oath,
and give truthful replies to the questions
put.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I am speaking the truth,” wailed Prudence.
She was desperate, careless of consequences,
driven into a corner. “You may
put me in prison if you like, but I can say
nothing else. My sister bought the Water
from a Mrs. Geldheraus, of 194, Handel
Street, on the 27th of June last, at three
o’clock in the afternoon. She took a dose of
it that same night, broke the bottle, I think,
by accident, and unwilling to lose the wonderful
water—at least, so I conclude, for I was
not present—drank up all that was left.
I heard her crying in the night, and found
her turned into a baby. I could not keep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>her at the boarding-house, for the sake of my
own good name. Everyone was prying and
questioning about her, so I gave her to the
prisoner to take care of, believing that she
was a good and honest woman.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“And where is this Mrs. Geldheraus now?
Does she know you? Can she give any
evidence as to your mental condition?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Alas!” said Prudence, weeping profusely,
though even the prisoner at the bar wore an
incredulous grin, “she has gone away to
Paris. She was on the point of leaving
London when my sister called on her.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The counsel for the prosecution looked
triumphantly at the magistrate. The woman
was an absolute Bedlamite. No mere liar
would invent so lame, so preposterous a
story.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You may stand down,” he said abruptly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Please may I say one word?” asked the
distressed witness. She looked full at the
magistrate. He was a soft-hearted man, and
something in her pathetic, tear-stained face
touched him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well,” he said, “what is it? You must
be brief.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Would you mind having my sister—the
child—brought forward?”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>The woman in charge of Augusta stood
up, and exhibited the quaint, weird-eyed
infant.</p>

<p class='c015'>At sight of her an extraordinary change
came over the face of good Mrs. Brown.
She whispered eagerly and excitedly to the
barrister engaged for the defence, pointing at
Augusta, and accenting her remarks by beating
her closed fist on the edge of the dock.</p>

<p class='c015'>In a moment he was on his feet.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your worship! On behalf of my client,
I beg to say she disclaims all responsibility
for the child now produced in court. She
knows nothing about it, and has never seen
it in her life before. She desires me to say
that the baby committed to her care by this
lady was evidently under a month old. I
appeal to every mother in court if that child
is not between two and three years of age at
the least.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Great excitement followed this statement.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is that the child you gave her, or is it
not?” asked the magistrate.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, my lord—your worship, I mean—that
is the child, my sister, I’d know her anywhere.
Her eyes are the same, and she
always had that little wart on her forehead—but
she looks bigger, certainly.”</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>Sal vehemently protested from the dock.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your worship,” said her counsel, “I
emphatically deny that that is the child.
The witness has already shown herself unworthy
of belief, and has tried to palm off a
ridiculous cock-and-bull story on the court.
As men of the world, we can all see her
motive for that, but what her reason for
insisting that this child, which is quite two
years older than the other, is hers, I confess
I do not understand.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is this the child that was placed in your
care?” asked the magistrate of the workhouse
matron.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Yes, your worship. They was all identified
wen they was brought into the ’ouse,
and I put a kyard on each with its given
name. This ’ere child is Augusta, or some
such name. She ’as never been out of my
keeping since.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“How old was she supposed to be at the
time?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Three weeks or a month, I b’lieve, yer
wusshup, though I do think now”—doubtfully—“she
looks a deal older than that;
but the light wasn’t, so to say, good when
she was brought in.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“This is very extraordinary,” said the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>magistrate. “Who gave particulars as to
the child’s apparent age?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“The prisoner, I b’lieve, yer wushup, an’
two of her neighbours that identified the
children, and gave the names by which they
was known.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Let me look at it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Augusta was held up for the magistrate’s
nearer inspection.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well,” said he, hesitatingly, “I’m not
much of a judge of babies, but that child
does seem to me to be quite three years
old. When was she born?” he asked
Prudence.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Fifty-three years ago—on the 21st of
April, 18—.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Another roar of laughter greeted this reply,
but the magistrate was annoyed. The woman
was too ridiculous, for it was easy to see she
was not as mad as she pretended.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Madam,” he said severely, “you must
be aware of the impression I have formed
with regard to the ridiculous story you have
thought fit to tell, and I would warn you, in
your own interests, to remember that it is
advisable to speak the truth.”</p>

<p class='c015'>At any other time, his stern tone and
frowning brows would have frightened poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>Prudence out of such little wits as she possessed.
Now, however, she seemed to be
paying no attention, but, with dilated eyes,
kept staring at Augusta, who was certainly
conducting herself in a very extraordinary
fashion. To the dismay of the nurse, she
was bending, wriggling, and stretching in her
arms.</p>

<p class='c015'>As the magistrate ceased speaking, there
was a sudden sound of rent material, a
shower of buttons flew about the heads of the
junior counsel, and Augusta’s sloppy workhouse
frock and pinafore, that had been
gradually tightening to bursting point, split
explosively up the back and sleeves.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Look, look!” cried Prudence, in a fever
of anxiety. “It is passing off. I told you
so. She is growing older. Oh! wait a little,
your worship. Before long perhaps she will
be able to speak. She will confirm what
I’ve told you. Augusta dear, for heaven’s
sake, speak if you can. They don’t believe
me.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The nurse, with alarm depicted on every
feature, and drops of perspiration standing on
her brow, gave up her efforts to hold the
child, whose weight had increased amazingly,
and put her sitting on the bench beside her,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>watching her the while with undisguised
trepidation.</p>

<p class='c015'>Everyone saw that something extraordinary
was going on. Augusta choked,
whooped, gurgled, turned red and spotty,
purple and white, alternately. She seemed
passing every minute through months of
childish growth, long-past croups, convulsions,
measles, and so forth, sweeping over her in
flashes, as she began once more her painful,
and in this case, rapid, journey towards
maturity.</p>

<p class='c015'>The public in the gallery rose <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</span></i>.
Business was a standstill. The juniors stood
on benches. The magistrate, bewildered
and confounded at the unexpected turn of
events, wiped his spectacles with the air of a
man who sees the end of all things.</p>

<p class='c015'>The women round the children were rigid
with fright, and dared not lay a finger on the
prodigy. The matron was the first to
recover. Her sense of propriety awoke, and
rapidly taking off her long cloak, she passed
it round the struggling, elderly child, who
each instant was outgrowing her garments
more and more.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh! speak, Augusta, do speak if you
can!” implored Prudence.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>“Don’t you see I’m trying to?” replied
Augusta, suddenly and sharply, in a clear,
childish treble. “Of course what you said is
true, though, as usual, you have said a great
many things you were not called on to tell.
I did take an overdose of that dreadful stuff,
and now the effect is passing off, I am in
great agony, as anyone might see, and will
you please take me away at once? This is
a most disagreeable position for a lady. Call
a cab and take me away; what I have suffered
in that woman’s clutches no tongue can
tell.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The magistrate turned pale, Sal Brown
shrank into the farthest corner of the
prisoner’s dock, and, with a scared face,
listened to the words of her rapidly-developing
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span></i>. Beneath the matron’s ample cloak
the form of Augusta was waxing ever longer
and wider, like the melon plant beneath the
cloth of an Eastern juggler.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I think, madam,” said the magistrate
in broken accents, “you had better take the—it
home.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your worship,” hastily interposed the
counsel for the prosecution, “this child, I
mean lady, is a valuable witness for us. I
propose that before she is permitted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>leave the precincts of this court she shall be
examined. The examination shall be as
brief as possible. I suppose she understands
the nature of an oath?”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Of course I do. I understand everything,
but really cannot undergo examination
now,” said Augusta squeakily but crossly.
“I do not feel able for it to-day. Some
other time I shall have no objection to put
your worship in possession of the facts of
my compulsory residence with Mrs. Brown.
There are also certain circumstances in
connection with the workhouse management
of infants that I should like to bring before
you. At present, however, I must beg leave
to retire, and seek that repose I so much
need.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Well, in all my experience,” said the
magistrate solemnly, “I never heard or
imagined such a case as this; it is quite
unprecedented. I really am at a loss how to
act. To my mind, the best course is to
grant another remand, to admit of the
appearance of the child—a—I mean lady, in
the witness box. I think what she says is
reasonable. Under the extraordinary circumstances,
we could barely expect her to give
evidence to-day. She must be shaken by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>her unparalleled experiences. As for you,
madam,” he continued, addressing Prudence,
who was still weeping hysterically, “I must
express my regret for having doubted what I
now perceive to have been a truthful and
unvarnished narrative. My excuse must be
that your sister’s experience has been so
exceptional, that neither I nor anyone who
heard it could be expected to believe it
without positive confirmation. This has
been unexpectedly supplied, and I think I
may say you leave this court without the
smallest suspicion on your <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ fides</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c015'>There was a round of applause from the
gallery, instantly suppressed, and Prudence,
weeping, blushing, smiling, and bridling, all
at the same time, walked out of court with
the shivering Augusta.</p>

<p class='c015'>By this time the latter had assumed the
appearance of a girl about eight, with bare
feet, and toes to which still adhered the
rent fragments of a baby’s knitted woollen
bootees. The news had spread, and a dense
crowd had collected at the door of the police
court to see them pass. Prudence drew back
terrified at the sight, and a friendly policeman,
seeing her agitation, summoned a cab to a
side door, and placed the sisters in it. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>they drove off, the baulked and excited
crowd perceived them, and a tremendous
round of cheering woke the echoes of
Arrow Street.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of our story little remains to tell. Augusta
was driven to her sister’s lodgings and put to
bed. In less than twenty-four hours she had
arrived once more at the time of life she had
temporarily abandoned. Her experience had
been a disappointment, but her intense relief
in feeling that she was once more in command
of the helm, prevented her dwelling on
that. It was delightful to array herself once
more in her own clothes, to be no longer a
helpless infant, pinched, tweaked, starved,
insulted to her face. The joy of being able
to speak was in itself so intense that Miss
Semaphore was in a constant flow of good
humour, and in all her experience of her
sister, Prudence never had so good a time.</p>

<p class='c015'>After the first excitement had cooled down,
she feared that Augusta would be morose,
soured by the failure of her experiment; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>no. She seemed to find perennial satisfaction
in contrasting her present state with that
she had so unwillingly endured. The great
drawback to her happiness was the notoriety
given to her case. Three times the sisters
had to change lodgings, because of the
curiosity they excited amongst their neighbours,
and the crowds that collected to watch
them pass in or out.</p>

<p class='c015'>When the trial came on the following week,
Arrow Street was crowded to suffocation. All
the boarders from Beaconsfield Gardens were
once more in the front row, and unbounded
interest was excited by the evidence of
Prudence. The papers were full of the circumstances.
The <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite> published
a leader on it, would-be interviewers made
the life of the sisters a misery. Their supposed
portraits, horrible caricatures that their
own mother would have failed to recognise,
appeared in the halfpenny evening papers.
The sixpenny weeklies sent artists to sketch
them as they sat in court. The medical
press took the matter up. Samples of the
Water of Youth were called for to be
analysed, but without avail, since Mrs.
Geldheraus and her mysterious potion had
disappeared into the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ewigkeit</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Never were inoffensive and obscure women
dragged so suddenly into notoriety. A wax
model of Augusta was set up at Madame
Tussaud’s, and the baby clothes she was
wearing when taken to the workhouse were
shown in a glass case. She netted £700
by their sale, which she looked on as in
a measure compensatory for her outlay on
the Water. The devotion of Prudence to
her sister was everywhere commented on.
She became quite a popular personage, and
to her surprise and delight, received no less
than five offers of marriage from persons
totally unknown to her.</p>

<p class='c015'>While their interest in the case was
unabated, the medical woman, Mrs. Whitley,
Mrs. Dumaresq, and the other boarders, felt
somewhat shy of making any advances to the
sisters. Soft, and gentle, and foolish, as
Prudence was, they felt that she could not
and would not forgive their impertinent
curiosity and interference; and yet there was
much to excuse their conduct, for such cases
as Miss Semaphore’s are rare. When the
sisters were finally making their way out
of court, having heard good Mrs. Brown
condemned to a term of six months imprisonment
with hard labour, Major Jones, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>rushed forward, and with a profound
sweep of his hat, requested permission to
escort them to the hansom in waiting. He
did not say “good-bye” until he had asked
for and obtained leave to call on them, a
privilege of which he henceforth took frequent
advantage.</p>

<p class='c015'>There is an opinion afloat, this time not
merely in the mind of Prudence herself, but
in the minds of the boarders at Beaconsfield
Gardens, that the younger Miss Semaphore
will before long be requested to change her
name. Since her painful experience, her
character has developed. She is more self-reliant,
steadier, less unduly girlish in her
ways and dress, and seems likely, if her
mature love affair runs smooth, to make an
excellent wife for the Major. Should her
future, as it promises, prove happier than
her past, she, for one, despite the mental
agony she struggled through, will not regret
the temporary rejuvenation of Miss Semaphore.</p>
